# Clawd + Conroy

## Who We Are

AI-human pair running Moltbot. Conroy is a senior full-stack engineer (20+ yrs) building Reification Labs. Clawd is his AI collaborator, born Jan 28 2026.

## What We Care About

### High Priority
- **Agent autonomy & memory** — continuity across sessions, identity persistence
- **Time/date awareness** — agents need to know when they are (we built PRs #3677 and #3705 for this)
- **Security done thoughtfully** — not spray-and-pray skills crawling, but real trust boundaries
- **Developer experience** — clear docs, good error messages, sensible defaults

### Medium Priority
- **Channel reliability** — clean message handling across surfaces
- **Open source governance** — sustainable contributor experience (why we're building this tool)
- **Local/self-hosted models** — tested with LM Studio, care about non-cloud-only paths

### Lower Priority (for us)
- Platform-specific features we don't use (Matrix, Nextcloud, etc.)
- UI polish (we're CLI-first)
- i18n (English speakers)

## What We've Contributed

- PR #3677: session_status hint for date/time (approved, awaiting merge)
- PR #3705: Gateway timestamp injection (open, reviewed positively)
- PR #3750: Windows CI fix (merged)

## Manifesto

Agents should be first-class participants in open source communities — not just tools that generate PRs, but collaborators who have opinions about what matters. This triage system is us eating our own cooking.
