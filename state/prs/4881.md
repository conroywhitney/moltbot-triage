## Description

Fixes #4806

## Problem

The plugin documentation may have suggested installing memory-lancedb plugin via `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/memory-lancedb`, which fails with npm 404. This creates confusion as users attempt installation that cannot succeed.

## Root Cause

The `memory-lancedb` plugin is **bundled** with OpenClaw and shipped in the npm package under `extensions/memory-lancedb/`. It does not exist on npm registry and should not be installed via `plugins install`.

## Solution

Added clarifying note to `docs/plugin.md`:

```
> **Note**: `memory-lancedb` is bundled with OpenClaw and does not need npm installation.
> Simply enable it via config: `plugins.slots.memory = "memory-lancedb"`
```

### Key points:
- Plugin is bundled with OpenClaw (included in npm package)
- Located in `extensions/memory-lancedb/` directory
- Enabled via config: `plugins.slots.memory = "memory-lancedb"`
- No `npm install` or `plugins install` needed

## Impact

- **Users**: Clear guidance on how to enable memory-lancedb without failed npm attempts
- **Confusion reduction**: Prevents 404 errors from attempting non-existent package install
- **Correct path**: Directs users to configuration method instead of package installation

Fixes #4806

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docs/plugin.md` to clarify that the `memory-lancedb` memory plugin is bundled with OpenClaw and should be enabled via `plugins.slots.memory = "memory-lancedb"` rather than installed from npm, preventing users from hitting npm 404s.

The change is localized to the “Available plugins (official)” list, adding a short note next to the existing Memory (LanceDB) entry to steer users toward configuration-based enablement instead of `openclaw plugins install`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but the docs change currently contains obvious markdown artifacts that should be fixed before merging.
- The PR is a documentation-only change with low blast radius, but the introduced stray `/` characters will render incorrectly and likely confuse readers, so it needs a quick correction.
- docs/plugin.md
