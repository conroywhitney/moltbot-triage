## Description

## Summary

When agents are added or removed via config changes, the heartbeat scheduler now restarts automatically. This ensures newly added agents get their heartbeat tasks scheduled without requiring a full gateway restart.

**Use case**: In multi-tenant deployments where agents are dynamically registered (e.g., via extension plugins), new agents need their heartbeat tasks to start without restarting the entire gateway.

## Changes

- Added `agents.list` to `BASE_RELOAD_RULES` with `restart-heartbeat` action
- Added test case to verify the behavior

## Test plan

- [x] `pnpm exec vitest run src/gateway/config-reload.test.ts` passes (9 tests)
- [ ] CI passes
