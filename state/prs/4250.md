## Description

Fixes #4232

## Problem

When users forward messages with large files to the bot, the error handler was failing to catch the Telegram API error because it only checked for errors containing "exceeds" and "MB limit". The actual error from Telegram says "file is too big", so it was falling through and the user got no feedback.

## Solution

Updated the error condition to also match "file is too big" errors. Now users get a proper response telling them the file is too large instead of silence.

## Testing

- Build passes
- Lint passes
- Error handling logic now covers both error message formats
