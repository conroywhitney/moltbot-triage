<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Pi embedded helper error classifier to treat “unknown/invalid model name” failures as a `FailoverReason` (`"unknown"`), so `runWithModelFallback` will execute fallback profiles instead of hard-failing on a primary model that doesn’t exist. It adds unit coverage to verify both the classification (`classifyFailoverReason("Unknown model: …") -> "unknown"`) and that `runWithModelFallback` retries with the expected fallback provider/model. A changelog entry documents the user-visible behavior change (in addition to other fixes already in that section).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; the change is small and covered by targeted unit tests.
- Core logic change is limited to adding an “unknown model” classifier and using it in failover reason selection; added tests assert the intended fallback path. Main remaining concern is the broadness of one pattern (e.g., "does not exist") potentially misclassifying unrelated errors as unknown-model, which could trigger unintended fallbacks.
