## Description

When creating a cron job without explicit `enabled` field, it would have `enabled=undefined` which is treated as falsy by the scheduler, causing jobs to never run.

## Changes
- `src/cron/service/jobs.ts`: Change `enabled: input.enabled` to `enabled: input.enabled ?? true`

## Testing
- Verified that new cron jobs without explicit `enabled` field now default to `enabled: true`
- Existing jobs with explicit `enabled: false` still work correctly

Fixes #5918

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts cron job creation so that `enabled` defaults to `true` when omitted (`enabled: input.enabled ?? true`). This aligns runtime behavior with the scheduler’s current checks (multiple paths treat falsy `enabled` as disabled), preventing newly-created jobs from being silently skipped when callers don’t set the field.

Change is isolated to `src/cron/service/jobs.ts` in `createJob`, and does not affect patch/update flows (explicit `enabled: false` remains respected via `applyJobPatch`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a one-line defaulting fix using nullish coalescing, localized to cron job creation; it preserves explicit false and matches existing scheduler semantics that treat falsy enabled as disabled.
- No files require special attention
