## Description

fix(macos-app): patch SwiftPM Bundle.module accessor for app bundle compatibility

Problem

SwiftPM's auto-generated resource_bundle_accessor.swift files use Bundle.main.bundleURL.appendingPathComponent(...) to locate package resource bundles. This resolves to .app/Package_Target.bundle at the app root.

However:

• macOS app bundles put resources in .app/Contents/Resources/
• Code signing prohibits arbitrary files/symlinks at the app root
• This causes EXC_BREAKPOINT crashes when packages like Textual try Bundle.module.url(forResource:) (e.g., prism-bundle.js for syntax highlighting)
Crash trace:

Thread 0 Crashed: 
0 libswiftCore.dylib _assertionFailure
1 Clawdbot closure #1 in variable initialization expression of static NSBundle.module
2 Clawdbot CodeTokenizer.init()

Solution

After the first swift build (which generates accessors), patch all resource_bundle_accessor.swift files:

- let mainPath = Bundle.main.bundleURL.appendingPathComponent("textual_Textual.bundle").path
+ let mainPath = (Bundle.main.resourceURL ?? Bundle.main.bundleURL).appendingPathComponent("textual_Textual.bundle").path

• Falls back to resourceURL first (correct for .app/Contents/Resources/), then bundleURL (development builds)
• Rebuilds with patched accessors
• No upstream changes needed
Changes

• scripts/package-mac-app.sh: Add double-build + sed patching step
• Works for all arches, all packages (Textual, SwiftUIMath, ClawdbotKit, etc.)
• Minimal overhead (~1-2s rebuild)
Testing

1. BUNDLE_ID=dev.rwx.ai.bot ./scripts/package-mac-app.sh
2. Copy to /Applications/ → launches without crash ✅
3. Syntax highlighting works (uses Prism.js from Textual bundle) ✅
4. Codesign verifies ✅
Before/After

Development (swift run)
• Before: ✅
• After: ✅

Packaged .app
• Before: 💥 Crash on startup
• After: ✅ Launches + full functionality

Codesign
• Before: ✅
• After: ✅

Fixes #1709 (https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/issues/1709) (Textual/CodeTokenizer crash).


Closes: #1709
Type: Fix
Scope: macos-app, swiftpm

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` to patch SwiftPM-generated `resource_bundle_accessor.swift` files so `Bundle.module` resolves resources via `Bundle.main.resourceURL` inside a signed `.app` bundle (instead of `bundleURL` at the app root). The script now performs an initial `swift build` per-arch to generate accessors, rewrites the accessor code via `sed`, then rebuilds and continues packaging by copying resource bundles (including adding SwiftUIMath’s bundle) into `Moltbot.app/Contents/Resources`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but the build-step error handling could mask failures and produce flaky packaged apps.
- The change is localized to a packaging script and aligns with macOS bundle resource layout, but the new `swift build ... || true` can let the script proceed without actually generating/patching accessors, making failures harder to diagnose and potentially reintroducing the crash at runtime.
- scripts/package-mac-app.sh (new build+patch loop and error handling)

**`scripts/package-mac-app.sh`**
[P0] Ignoring the first `swift build` failure can silently leave accessors unpatched and produce a broken app.

Because the first build is `... || true`, if generation fails (missing deps, wrong toolchain, transient SwiftPM error), the patch loop will find nothing and the second build will run anyway; you’ll only find out later at runtime. Consider removing `|| true` or explicitly failing if no `resource_bundle_accessor.swift` files were found/patched for the target.
