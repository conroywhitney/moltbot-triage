## Description

## Summary

Fixes #4529

The  compatibility package was broken because  was missing. This file is referenced in  but was never created during the openclaw rename (commit 9a7160786).

## Problem

Users who:
1. Had  installed globally
2. Upgraded by running `git pull` and rebuilding
3. Tried to run `moltbot gateway restart`

Could not connect to the gateway because their global  binary had no working shim to forward commands to .

## Solution

This PR adds the missing `packages/moltbot/bin/moltbot.js` binary that:
- Forwards all commands to `openclaw/cli-entry`
- Shows clear deprecation warning on every run
- Guides users to migrate to the `openclaw` package

## Testing

```bash
# Requires built openclaw
node packages/moltbot/bin/moltbot.js --version
```

Expected output:
- Deprecation warning in yellow/cyan
- Forwarded to openclaw command

## Impact

This will allow users who have the old `moltbot` package installed globally to:
1. Use their existing installation with clear migration guidance
2. Gradually migrate to `openclaw` package at their convenience
3. Not be blocked by gateway connection errors
