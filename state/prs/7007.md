## Description

### Problem
OpenClaw's legacy state-dir migration intentionally creates a symlink like ~/.clawdbot -> ~/.openclaw. On POSIX, symlink mode bits are not meaningful, but the security audit was using lstat() and treating the symlink's 777 bits as world-writable, producing a critical false-positive.

### Fix
- Keep reporting the state dir as a symlink (trust boundary warning).
- Evaluate read/write bits on the symlink target via stat() (follows symlink) on non-Windows platforms.

### Tests
- Added a POSIX test that creates a state dir symlink to a 0700 dir and asserts we warn about symlink but do not flag world-writable.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Updates the filesystem permission audit to treat POSIX symlink mode bits as non-authoritative: it still flags the state directory as a symlink (trust-boundary warning), but derives read/write bits from the symlink target via `stat()` (following the link) on non-Windows platforms. Adds a regression test ensuring a symlinked state dir pointing to a `0700` directory triggers the symlink warning without incorrectly flagging world-writable perms.

This fits into the existing `src/security` audit framework by refining `inspectPathPermissions()` to report more accurate POSIX permission findings while preserving the existing Windows ACL-based checks.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge and fixes a real false-positive, with minor consistency/cleanup issues to consider.
- The change is localized and aligns with POSIX semantics for symlink mode bits, and the added test covers the reported regression. Remaining concerns are minor: an internal inconsistency in `inspectPathPermissions()` on the Windows codepath (bits computed outside the branch) and test temp-dir cleanup.
- src/security/audit-fs.ts (Windows branch consistency); src/security/audit.test.ts (temp dir cleanup).

**`src/security/audit-fs.ts`**
[P1] `bits` is computed from `effectiveMode` before the Windows ACL branch, but the Windows branch returns `mode: st.mode`/`isDir: st.isDir` while keeping `bits` from `effectiveMode` (which may have been derived via `fs.stat()` when the path is a symlink). This can lead to internally inconsistent results on Windows (e.g., `mode`/`isDir` disagree with `bits`), and it also does extra (unused) work on Windows.

Consider moving `const bits = ...` below the `if (platform === "win32")` block or using `st.mode` inside the Windows branch to keep the returned fields consistent.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
