## Description

Fixes #4596

## Problem
The  dependency was missing native bindings for 32-bit ARM Linux (), causing OpenClaw to crash on startup on platforms like Raspberry Pi 3 and earlier devices.

The error occurred when the clipboard module tried to load the missing  package, which doesn't exist in the npm registry.

## Solution
This PR patches the clipboard module to gracefully handle missing native bindings:

1. **Emits a warning** instead of throwing a fatal error when native bindings are unavailable
2. **Provides stub implementations** that throw informative errors when clipboard functions are called
3. **Allows OpenClaw to start and run normally** on unsupported platforms

The patch is applied via pnpm's patch mechanism, which modifies the clipboard module at install time without requiring a fork.

## Technical Details
- Added a pnpm patch for `@mariozechner/clipboard@0.3.0`
- Modified the module's error handling to be non-fatal
- Stub implementations inform users that clipboard operations are unavailable on their platform
- OpenClaw's own clipboard implementation (in `src/infra/clipboard.ts`) uses system commands and is unaffected

## Testing
The patch allows the module to load successfully, and OpenClaw should start without errors on linux-arm-gnueabihf systems. Clipboard operations in the pi-coding-agent will throw informative errors if called, but won't crash the application.
