## Description

This PR adds a new **Telegram User** channel plugin (`@clawdbot/telegram-user`), allowing Clawdbot to act as a real user (not a bot) using the MTProto protocol via `@mtcute`.

**Key Features:**
*   **User Authentication**: Login via QR code or Phone Code.
*   **Full Group Support**: Works in DMs, Supergroups, and Forum Topics.
*   **Rich Content**:
    *   **Polls**: Create and vote on polls.
    *   **Media**: Send/Receive images, videos, and files (with size limits).
    *   **Location**: Share and receive location pins/live locations.

**Implementation Details:**
*   Live in `extensions/telegram-user`.
*   Uses `@mtcute/node` for the MTProto client.
*   Follows standard Clawdbot patterns (pairing, allowlists, command gating).

**Documentation:**
*   Added `docs/channels/telegram-user.md`.

Note (unrelated to telegram-user):
- Added `extensions/memory-core/package.json` `devDependencies.clawdbot="workspace:*"` to prevent `pnpm install` at repo root from attempting to fetch `clawdbot@>=2026.1.25` from npm.

Closing: Large PRs (1000+ lines) require prior alignment with maintainers before submission. Please:

1. Open an issue first to discuss the feature/change
2. Get maintainer buy-in on the approach
3. Consider breaking into smaller, reviewable PRs

We appreciate your interest in contributing, but reviewing massive unaligned PRs is not sustainable. Feel free to reopen after discussing the approach in an issue.
