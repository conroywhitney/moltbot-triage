## Description

## Problem

The sidebar logo in the Control UI fails to load with a 403 Forbidden error. The CDN URL `mintcdn.com/clawhub/...` has an expired or domain-locked signature that fails for self-hosted and Docker deployments.

## Solution

Replace the external CDN URL with the local `/favicon.svg` (absolute path) which is already bundled in the UI public assets.

## Changes

- `ui/src/ui/app-render.ts`: Replace CDN URL with `/favicon.svg`

## Testing

- Tested on local Docker deployment
- Logo now loads correctly from local assets
- Used absolute path per Greptile feedback (relative `./` would break on nested routes)

Fixes #6135
Fixes #6365
