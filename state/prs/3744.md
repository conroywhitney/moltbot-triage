## Description

## Summary
Fixes a bug where the Control UI dashboard fails to connect with "pairing required" error when a browser reconnects after a failed pairing attempt.

## Problem
When a browser connects to the dashboard (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:18789/?token=...`), if there's already a pending pairing request with `silent: false` from a previous connection attempt, subsequent local connection retries would fail because:

1. `requestDevicePairing()` returns the existing pending request unchanged
2. The request remains `silent: false`, preventing auto-approval
3. Gateway rejects the connection with "pairing required" before showing the pairing code

This commonly occurs in Docker setups where the initial connection may not be detected as local due to Docker bridge network addressing.

## Solution
Update `requestDevicePairing()` to upgrade existing pending requests to `silent: true` when a new local connection retries. This allows auto-approval to proceed even if the original request was non-silent.

## Changes
- **Core Fix**: `src/infra/device-pairing.ts` - Check if new request is `silent: true` and update existing pending request
- **Test**: `src/infra/device-pairing.test.ts` - Add test case for silent flag upgrade behavior  
- **Docs**: `docs/gateway/pairing.md` - Document the silent flag upgrade behavior
- **Docs**: `docs/install/docker.md` - Add Docker configuration guidance for Control UI access
- **Changelog**: Add entry for the fix

## Testing
- ✅ Added unit test verifying silent flag upgrade
- ✅ Tested with Docker setup: `docker compose run --rm moltbot-cli dashboard`
- ✅ Verified dashboard connects successfully after clearing pairing state
- ✅ Linter passes
