## Description

Turns out plugin logs were going to stdout during completion generation, which completely breaks the standard `source <(openclaw completion --shell bash)` pattern in .bashrc/.zshrc.

Shell tries to execute stuff like `[plugins] feishu_doc...` as commands, causing errors on every terminal launch.

Fix: call `routeLogsToStderr()` before loading subcommands. stdout stays clean for the actual completion script.

Tested locally, all passed.

Fixes #6236

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR routes CLI logs to **stderr** during `openclaw completion` generation by calling `routeLogsToStderr()` at the start of the `completion` command action in `src/cli/completion-cli.ts`. The intent is to keep **stdout** reserved for the actual completion script so patterns like `source <(openclaw completion --shell bash)` don’t break when plugins emit log lines during subcommand registration.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small, well-scoped behavior fix (rerouting logs before subcommand/plugin loading) and it aligns with the stated goal of keeping completion output clean; no other control flow or data paths are affected.
- No files require special attention
