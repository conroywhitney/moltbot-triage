## Description

## Summary\n\nSmall docs-only update to make security reports safer and reduce accidental credential leakage.\n\n## Changes\n- Add a short redaction reminder for logs/configs/screenshots\n- Add a quick hardening checklist (least privilege, localhost binding, secret handling, token rotation)\n\n## Why\nOpenClaw often runs with access to messaging accounts and local files; clarifying redaction + basic hardening helps users report issues safely and operate more securely.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `SECURITY.md` with (1) a brief reminder to redact secrets when sharing logs/configs/screenshots and (2) a concise hardening checklist (localhost-only UI binding, least-privilege credentials, secret storage hygiene, treating chat inputs as untrusted, and token rotation guidance). These additions strengthen the project’s security reporting and operational guidance without changing runtime behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge and should not affect runtime behavior.
- Changes are documentation-only and are aligned with secure reporting/operations guidance; the main minor risk is a hard-coded external docs link becoming stale over time.
- SECURITY.md (verify external link policy/expected canonical docs URL)

**`SECURITY.md`**
[P2] This includes a hard-coded docs URL which can go stale or be misleading if the canonical location changes. Consider referencing the docs via a relative link in the repo or a named link to the primary docs entrypoint used elsewhere in the project (or explain what the URL is expected to contain).

Severity depends on how often this file is used as the canonical pointer for security guidance; if users rely on it, outdated links can send them to the wrong place.

Good catch — updated SECURITY.md to reference the in-repo docs (docs/gateway/security/index.md) and note the published path (/gateway/security), so we avoid a hard-coded domain URL. Pushed in 6ac9f4334.
