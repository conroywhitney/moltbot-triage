Resolves the Node.js punycode deprecation warning that appears in gateway logs.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates dependency resolution to eliminate the Node.js `punycode` deprecation warning seen in gateway logs by overriding `whatwg-url` to `7.1.0` (which uses the userland `punycode.js` implementation). It records the change in `CHANGELOG.md` and updates `pnpm-lock.yaml` accordingly (notably bumping `whatwg-url` and its transitive deps `tr46` and `webidl-conversions`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; it’s a targeted dependency override with limited blast radius, but it changes URL parsing-related transitive deps so it warrants a quick smoke test in the gateway runtime.
- Changes are confined to dependency metadata (package.json overrides + lockfile) and a changelog entry, with no application code modifications. The main risk is subtle behavior differences from the `whatwg-url`/`tr46`/`webidl-conversions` upgrades in codepaths that construct/parse URLs (e.g., node-fetch consumers).
- package.json (overrides), pnpm-lock.yaml (transitive dependency upgrades)
