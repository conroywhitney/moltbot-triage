## Description

Since pnpm build only compiles the project files into the dist/ directory but does not install the openclaw binary to your system's global PATH, the command openclaw explicitly will not be found in your terminal.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the “From source (development)” instructions to run onboarding via `pnpm openclaw ...` instead of relying on a globally installed `openclaw` binary, aligning the docs with the fact that `pnpm build` produces `dist/` output but doesn’t put `openclaw` on PATH.

Change is localized to `docs/start/getting-started.md` and improves the out-of-the-box developer experience when building/running OpenClaw directly from the repo.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge and only adjusts documentation guidance.
- The change is a small docs-only update that makes source-development instructions more accurate; the only risk is minor user confusion if adjacent examples use different invocation styles.
- docs/start/getting-started.md

**`docs/start/getting-started.md`**
[P2] Consider using `pnpm openclaw ...` consistently (or explain the difference)

This section now uses `pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon`, which is correct for running the CLI from source without a global install, but the next snippet below still shows `node openclaw.mjs gateway ...`. If `pnpm openclaw` is the recommended dev entrypoint, it may be less confusing to use it consistently (or add a short note about when to use `node openclaw.mjs ...` vs `pnpm openclaw ...`).
