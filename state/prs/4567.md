## Description

Fixes Web UI `/new` not starting a fresh session (#4446).

Root cause: webchat often sends `SessionKey` as the `main` alias, but server-side session init didn’t canonicalize it to the real main session key. This caused resets to write to the alias while history reads from the canonical key, so the UI appeared unchanged.

## Changes 
- Canonicalize explicit `SessionKey` to the real main session key during session init
- Propagate the canonical key into the template context to keep all paths consistent
- Add a test to cover explicit `main` alias canonicalization
