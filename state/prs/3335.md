## Description

Fixes https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/2323

Cron jobs seems to have broken after https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/1535

The reason seems to be an early return that was added in the PR above, that would not the `system events` queue clear if `HEARTBEAT.md` is empty. 

Cron jobs are pushed to system events when executed, and hence the change ensures that if there are pending system events they should be executed irrespective of the `heartbeat.md` file being empty.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts the heartbeat runner’s “empty HEARTBEAT.md” early-return behavior so that pending system events (e.g., cron-triggered reminders queued into the per-session system-events queue) still cause a heartbeat run. It adds tests covering the new behavior (run when HEARTBEAT.md is effectively empty but system events exist; still skip when empty and no events).

The change integrates with existing heartbeat logic by checking the session’s system-events queue before applying the cost-saving skip, ensuring cron/system-event delivery isn’t blocked by an empty heartbeat file.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and addresses the reported cron/system-events regression with targeted tests.
- The functional change is small and well-scoped (only gating the empty-heartbeat skip on presence of queued system events) and is covered by new tests. Main remaining risk is around edge cases where `sessionKey` resolution could be invalid and `hasSystemEvents` may throw earlier than before.
- src/infra/heartbeat-runner.ts (sessionKey/system-events check edge cases)

### @Glucksberg (2026-01-28)

This PR may help with several open cron issues:

**Issues this could address:**
- #3486 - Cron jobs fire repeatedly instead of once
- #3220 - Cron job with at schedule fires immediately
- #2813 - Cron job scheduled but never fired

**Related PRs:**
- #2990 - fix: Re-arm cron service timer with a delay
- #2183 - fix(cron): anchor every jobs to lastRunAtMs

Could you clarify which specific cron bugs this addresses? Would help with issue triage.

### @hkirat (2026-01-29)

This one specifically solves https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/2323 and potentially https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/2813

It should not affect https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/3220 and https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/3486
