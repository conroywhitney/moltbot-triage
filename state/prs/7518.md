- propagate bridge auth token through sandbox/browser tooling
- send auth headers for bridge requests

## Test plan

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR makes the browser bridge server always require authentication by ensuring a bridge auth token exists (auto-generating one when missing), then propagating that token through the sandbox/browser toolchain and attaching it to bridge client requests.

Flow-wise: `startBrowserBridgeServer` now always enforces `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the sandbox context exposes `bridgeAuthToken`, agent tool construction passes it into `createBrowserTool`, and browser client action functions accept `authToken` so the fetch layer can send the header.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but there’s a likely sandbox+nodeTarget auth gating bug and the fetch wrapper behavior needs verification.
- Auth-token propagation is conceptually straightforward, but `browser-tool.ts` appears to throw in a scenario where `authToken` is intentionally unset (nodeTarget proxy path). Additionally, correctness depends on `client-fetch` consistently applying the Authorization header on all requests.
- src/agents/tools/browser-tool.ts; src/browser/client-fetch.ts

[P0] Sandbox auth token guard likely blocks `nodeTarget` sandbox usage

`authToken` is set to `undefined` whenever `nodeTarget` is present, but the guard `if (resolvedTarget === "sandbox" && baseUrl && !authToken)` will still throw for `nodeTarget` sandbox calls even though those calls are proxied and won’t send `authToken` directly. This can make sandbox+nodeTarget flows fail even if the bridge token is configured.

Consider restricting the guard to the direct-call path (e.g. require `authToken` only when `!nodeTarget && resolvedTarget==="sandbox"`).

[P1] Verify `authToken` is applied to all bridge fetches (incl. GET)

Now that the bridge server always 401s without `Authorization`, the fetch wrapper needs to consistently translate `authToken` into `Authorization: Bearer ...` for every request (including GETs like status/profiles). If any call sites bypass the wrapper or the header is only applied for POSTs, sandbox browser tooling will break.

### @hclsys (2026-02-02)

Fixed P0: guard now only requires auth token for direct sandbox calls (exclude nodeTarget), so proxied nodeTarget + sandbox won't be blocked.\n\nP1 check: authToken is applied for all HTTP requests (GET/POST/DELETE) via fetchBrowserJson -> buildAuthHeaders; all browser client calls route through fetchBrowserJson, so auth header coverage is consistent. No code change needed there.

I opened a fix PR for the failing browser tool test (profiles call signature): #7589.
