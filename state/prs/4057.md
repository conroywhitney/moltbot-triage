## Description

Azure OpenAI enforces a 40-character limit on tool_calls[].id fields,
    which causes HTTP 400 errors when tool call IDs exceed this limit.

    Add Azure OpenAI detection (via provider name containing "azure") and
    enable tool call ID sanitization for Azure providers.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `resolveTranscriptPolicy` (`src/agents/transcript-policy.ts`) to detect “Azure OpenAI” providers and enable transcript/tool-call sanitization to avoid Azure’s 40-character `tool_calls[].id` limit.

The policy object returned here is consumed by the session history/message sanitizers (e.g. `sanitizeSessionMessagesImages`), so toggles like `sanitizeToolCallIds` and `toolCallIdMode` directly affect whether outbound requests have tool-call IDs rewritten into a stricter format.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is because the main intended behavior change appears not to take effect for Azure OpenAI.
- The PR adds an `isAzureOpenAi` flag and includes it in `sanitizeToolCallIds`/`needsNonImageSanitize`, but the returned policy still gates `sanitizeToolCallIds` behind `!isOpenAi`, so Azure (which uses OpenAI APIs) likely won’t have tool-call IDs sanitized and will continue to hit 400s. Azure detection logic is also heuristic and may miss real Azure configs depending on provider naming/normalization.

**`src/agents/transcript-policy.ts`**
[P1] Azure detection via `provider.includes("azure")` is fragile/likely to miss configs.

`provider` is normalized via `normalizeProviderId(...)`, and many setups name the provider something like `azure-openai` or just `azure` (not necessarily paired with an OpenAI modelApi), while others may not include the substring at all. As written, Azure will only be detected when `modelApi` is in `OPENAI_MODEL_APIS` *and* the normalized provider string still contains `azure`, which risks silently skipping sanitization for actual Azure providers.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
