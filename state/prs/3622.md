## Description

## Summary
Drops orphan toolResult messages that arrive without a matching pending tool call, preventing corrupted transcripts that can trigger repeated "No tool call found" loops.

## Details
- Adds a guard option (default enabled) to ignore orphan toolResult messages.
- Wires the option through the guard wrapper.
- Adds a test to cover the orphan-drop behavior.

## Why
A session can end up with a toolResult persisted without its toolCall (e.g., interrupted tool call). Replaying that session repeatedly hits the error and can burn tokens. This prevents new corruption at persistence time.

## Tests
- `pnpm vitest src/agents/session-tool-result-guard.test.ts`

## Issue
Closes #3621

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR extends the session tool-result guard to optionally drop “orphan” `toolResult` messages (default enabled) that don’t correspond to a currently-pending tool call, and threads the option through the guard wrapper. It also adds a vitest case asserting that an orphan `toolResult` is ignored.

Overall this fits the existing guard’s responsibility (normalizing transcript/tool-call pairing and optionally synthesizing missing results) and should help prevent persistence-time corruption loops when replaying sessions.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge and is narrowly scoped to transcript persistence behavior.
- Changes are small and localized (an additional guard branch plus wiring and a targeted test). Main functional concern is that malformed `toolResult` messages without an id are still persisted, which may still allow corruption in some edge cases, but the default orphan-drop should mitigate the reported loop for id-bearing orphans.

**`src/agents/session-tool-result-guard.ts`**
[P2] `pending.get(id)` before the orphan check is redundant and can be misleading.

`toolName` is read from `pending` even when `id` isn’t pending (the orphan-drop branch returns early anyway). It’s minor, but moving the orphan check before reading `toolName` makes the control flow clearer and avoids accidental future use of a `toolName` that didn’t come from a real pending call.
