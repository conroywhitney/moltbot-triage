<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `formatRelativeTime` (`src/utils/time-format.ts`) to handle future timestamps by returning phrases like `in Xm`, `in Xh`, `Tomorrow`, and `in Xd`, falling back to a locale date string for longer ranges. It also adds Vitest coverage for both past and future cases (`src/utils/time-format.test.ts`).

This function is used in the TUI session list (e.g., `src/tui/tui-command-handlers.ts:152`), so these new strings will show up in session descriptions when timestamps are in the future.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge; changes are localized and covered by unit tests.
- The implementation is straightforward and tests cover representative past/future outputs. Main remaining concern is the rounding behavior for future times near unit boundaries (hours/days), which could produce slightly surprising strings but won’t crash or corrupt state.
- src/utils/time-format.ts

### @lawyered0 (2026-02-02)

Thanks Greptile. Agree on boundary rounding—happy to tweak if it proves noisy, but current behavior matches past-time handling and keeps UI stable.
