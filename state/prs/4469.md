## Description

This PR migrates the GitHub Copilot integration from a custom device-flow OAuth implementation to the official `@github/copilot-sdk`. The SDK manages a Copilot CLI subprocess for authentication and API access, providing a more robust and maintainable integration.

### Key Changes

####  New Features

**Official Copilot SDK Integration** (`feat(providers): migrate GitHub Copilot to official SDK`)
- Added `@github/copilot-sdk` dependency (v0.1.19)
- Created `github-copilot-sdk.ts` as the core SDK wrapper
- Added SDK-based model discovery via `listCopilotModels()`
- Updated login flow to verify CLI auth status instead of custom device flow

#### Refactoring

**Type Safety Improvements** (`refactor: Add isCachedToken type guard`)
- Added `CachedToken` interface for cached token data
- Added `isCachedToken()` type guard for proper runtime type checking
- Removed unnecessary `await` from synchronous cache file operations

**Code Cleanup**
- Renamed `github-copilot-auth.ts` to `github-copilot-login.ts`
- Merged `github-copilot-token.ts` into `github-copilot-sdk.ts`
- Removed deprecated `copilot-proxy` extension entirely
- Removed copilot-proxy from auth choices and plugin auto-enable
