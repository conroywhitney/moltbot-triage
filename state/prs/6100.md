## Description

# Summary

This PR fixes an issue where generated images from the nano-banana-pro skill are not automatically attached/uploaded to chat channels like Discord or Telegram.
# Technical Details

* Bug: The image generation script was outputting the media token with a trailing space after the colon (e.g., MEDIA: /path/to/file).

* Constraint: According to OpenClaw's official media handling documentation, the MEDIA:<path-or-url> token must be provided on its own line with no spaces between the prefix and the path.

* Fix: Modified the print statement in generate_image.py to remove the extra whitespace, ensuring the OpenClaw parser can correctly identify and extract the media path for auto-attachment.

# Impact

* Restores the automatic image upload functionality for the nano-banana-pro skill.

* Ensures compliance with the OpenClaw media output specification.

* Fixes the "text-only" fallback issue where only the file path string was displayed instead of the actual image in Discord.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes auto-attachment for the `nano-banana-pro` skill by removing the extra whitespace after the `MEDIA:` prefix in `generate_image.py`, aligning the script’s output with OpenClaw’s media token parsing expectations (`MEDIA:<path-or-url>`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a one-line output formatting fix that aligns with documented `MEDIA:<path-or-url>` requirements and existing parser behavior; it does not affect control flow or external API usage.
- No files require special attention
