## Description

## Summary

Implements the session lifecycle hooks that were previously listed as "Future Events" in the docs.

### Changes

- **session:end**: Triggered before `/new` or `/reset` clears the session
  - Context: `sessionEntry` (previous session), `sessionId`, `sessionFile`, `reason` ("reset"), etc.
  
- **session:start**: Triggered when a new session begins
  - Context: `sessionEntry`, `sessionId`, `sessionFile`, `isReset` (true if triggered by reset command), etc.

### Use Cases

- Save session context/transcripts to external memory systems on session end
- Initialize session-specific resources on session start
- Audit session lifecycle events
- Trigger cleanup or archival workflows when sessions reset

### Docs

Updated `hooks.md` to move session events from "Future Events" to a new "Session Events" section with full documentation.
