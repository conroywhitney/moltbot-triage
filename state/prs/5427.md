## Description

## Summary
- Audio OGG files were leaking into context as `<file mime="text/plain">` blocks after transcription, consuming thousands of tokens with binary garbage
- Root cause: `resolveUtf16Charset` null-byte heuristic falsely identifies OGG binary as UTF-16, bypassing the audio skip guard
- Fix: move the `kind === "audio"` check before buffer download, alongside the existing image/video skip

Fixes #5382

## Test plan
- [x] New test: OGG buffer with high null-byte density is excluded from file blocks
- [x] `pnpm test` passes (16/16)
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes
- [x] `pnpm build` passes

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR prevents audio attachments from being included in `extractFileBlocks` by skipping `kind === "audio"` attachments early (mirroring existing image/video skips), which stops certain binary audio buffers (e.g., OGG with many NUL bytes) from being misclassified as UTF-16 text and leaking into `<file ...>` blocks. It updates `src/media-understanding/apply.test.ts` to assert audio attachments (including NUL-heavy OGG and text-like buffers) are excluded from file blocks.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with low risk and clearly addresses the reported audio-to-file-block leakage.
- Change is narrowly scoped (one early-continue for audio attachments in `extractFileBlocks`) and backed by targeted tests verifying OGG/text-like audio no longer produces file blocks; no broader behavior changes for documents are introduced.
- src/media-understanding/apply.ts (ensure skipping audio in file blocks aligns with desired product behavior for text-named audio files).
