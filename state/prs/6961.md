## Description

Fixes #6234

Browser containers require port mapping for CDP, but they were inheriting `network: none` from the sandbox docker config, which prevents `-p` flag from working.

This change forces `network: "bridge"` for browser containers.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes sandbox browser containers failing to publish CDP ports by overriding the inherited Docker network mode from `none` to `bridge` when creating the browser container.

The change is localized to `src/agents/sandbox/browser.ts`, where the browser container creation args are built using the sandbox Docker config but with `network: "bridge"` forced so `-p` port publishing works (CDP and optional noVNC are still bound to 127.0.0.1).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; the functional change is small and targeted to browser container networking.
- The diff is a one-line config override that addresses a clear Docker behavior (port publishing requires a non-`none` network). Main risk is the security/isolation implication of moving from `network: none` to `bridge` for the browser container, which should be explicitly justified/documented and verified against sandbox threat model.
- src/agents/sandbox/browser.ts
