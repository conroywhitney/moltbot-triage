## Description

I discussed this issue with @steipete before opening the PR. This is a bigger patch. It moves sandboxed file operations from the host inside the container. This is meant as a solution to security issues that could arise from symlink race-condition attacks when file ops are performed on the host. A completely secure host-side implementation is impossible as Node.js doesn't expose `openat()`.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR introduces a `SandboxFsBridge` that routes sandboxed file operations through `docker exec` inside the sandbox container rather than performing them on the host. Call sites for apply_patch, read/write/edit, and image loading were updated to use the bridge when sandboxed, and `loadWebMedia` was extended to support a custom `readFile` override.

Overall this aligns with the repo’s sandbox architecture by making file reads/writes occur in the same isolated environment as other sandboxed execution, reducing host-side TOCTOU/symlink race exposure.

Main things to double-check are API surface consistency (`execDocker` vs `execDockerRaw` cancellation), and error handling granularity in the new bridge (especially where errors are currently collapsed to “not found”).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with a couple of error-handling and API-consistency concerns worth addressing.
- The changes are cohesive and mostly mechanical rewires to route file I/O through a new sandbox bridge; the main risk areas are (1) cancellation propagation for docker calls due to the narrowed `execDocker` signature, and (2) `stat()` masking non-ENOENT errors as null, which can hide operational failures. No obvious security regressions were found in the new shell scripts (arguments are passed positionally and quoted).

**`src/agents/sandbox/fs-bridge.ts`**
[P1] `stat()` treats *any* non-zero `stat` exit as “not found”, which can mask real errors.

`runCommand(..., { allowFailure: true })` then `if (result.code !== 0) return null;` (src/agents/sandbox/fs-bridge.ts:161-167). This collapses permission errors, missing `stat` binary, invalid paths, etc. into ENOENT behavior, which can lead to confusing fallbacks (e.g., image path rewrite) and harder debugging.

It would be safer to only return `null` for the “no such file” case and throw (or propagate stderr) for other failures.

**`src/web/media.ts`**
[P2] New `loadWebMedia()` overload defaults `optimizeImages` to `true`, which changes behavior for callers passing options objects.

Previously, all callers effectively got `optimizeImages: true`. Now object callers get `optimizeImages: options.optimizeImages ?? true` (src/web/media.ts:221-234), but number/undefined callers also force `optimizeImages: true`. This is correct, but it’s easy to miss that object callers can now disable optimization (and bypass the previous implicit behavior).

If this is intentional, consider adding/adjusting a unit test to lock in the overload semantics (number vs. options object) so future refactors don’t regress it.
