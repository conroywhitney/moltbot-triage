## Description

I discussed this issue with @steipete before opening the PR. This is a bigger patch. It moves sandboxed file operations from the host inside the container. This is meant as a solution to security issues that could arise from symlink race-condition attacks when file ops are performed on the host. A completely secure host-side implementation is impossible as Node.js doesn't expose `openat()`.
