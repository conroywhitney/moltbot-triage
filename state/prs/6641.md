## Description

Adds a copy button to each fenced code block in the webchat markdown output. The button appears on hover in the top-right corner of the block and copies just that block's content.

Previously, the only copy option was the message-level "Copy as markdown" button which copies the entire message.

**How it works:**
- `MutationObserver` watches `.chat-thread` for new `<pre>` elements
- Each `<pre>` gets wrapped in a `.cb-code-wrapper` container with a positioned copy button
- Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with a checkmark confirmation (1.5s)
- Idempotent: `WeakSet` prevents double-observing, `data-` attribute skips processed blocks
- Touch devices: button always visible (no hover)

**Files:**
- `ui/src/ui/chat/code-block-copy.ts` (new)
- `ui/src/styles/chat/text.css` (css additions)
- `ui/src/ui/app-lifecycle.ts` (hook)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds per-code-block copy buttons to the web chat markdown output by injecting a wrapper + positioned button around each rendered `<pre>` element. A `MutationObserver` is registered from the UI lifecycle to handle newly streamed/added code blocks, and chat CSS is updated to show the button on hover (always visible on touch devices) with a copied-state checkmark.

This integrates with the existing chat rendering by augmenting DOM output post-render rather than changing the markdown renderer itself.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge, but the MutationObserver lifecycle needs attention to avoid leaks in long-lived sessions.
- The change is UI-only and self-contained, but it introduces a persistent `MutationObserver` without teardown and adds repeated DOM querying in `handleUpdated`; both can cause performance/memory issues over time depending on how the chat view mounts/unmounts.
