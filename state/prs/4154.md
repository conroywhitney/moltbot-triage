## Description

## Summary

When opening the dashboard with a `?session=` URL parameter, the session was being overwritten by `applySessionDefaults()` after the gateway connected. This broke direct links to specific sessions.

## Problem

External tools (like Kanban boards with per-project sessions) open dashboard URLs like:
```
/chat?session=agent:main:project-6
```

The URL session was correctly parsed in `applySettingsFromUrl()`, but then immediately overwritten when `applySnapshot()` → `applySessionDefaults()` ran after the gateway connection succeeded.

## Solution

Added a `sessionFromUrl` flag that's set when a session is explicitly provided via URL parameter. The `applySessionDefaults()` function now checks for this flag and skips overriding URL-provided sessions.

The flag is cleared after the first connection so that future reconnects can apply defaults if needed.

## Testing

- Verified typecheck passes (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Manual testing: open `/chat?session=agent:main:project-X` and verify the correct session loads

Fixes #4150

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes a regression where a `?session=` URL parameter was correctly parsed in `applySettingsFromUrl()`, but then overwritten after gateway connect when `applySnapshot()` applies `sessionDefaults`. The change introduces a `sessionFromUrl` flag set during URL parsing and checked in `applySessionDefaults()` to avoid overriding an explicit URL session, then clears the flag after the first successful snapshot application.

The approach fits the current architecture where the UI host object is used as a shared mutable state container across `app-settings` (URL parsing/persistence) and `app-gateway` (post-connect snapshot handling).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge, with one behavioral edge case around URL cleanup and repeated refreshes.
- Changes are small and localized, and the core logic matches the described bug. The main concern is that the `sessionFromUrl` flag will keep being re-set on every reload because the `session` query param isn’t removed, which may unintentionally disable session defaults beyond the first connection. No other correctness or security issues stood out in the touched code.
- ui/src/ui/app-settings.ts (URL param handling/cleanup semantics), ui/src/ui/app-gateway.ts (session defaults application logic)

**`ui/src/ui/app-settings.ts`**
[P1] `sessionFromUrl` flag is set but never cleared when the session comes from the URL.

In `applySettingsFromUrl`, the `session` param is not deleted from `params` / `shouldCleanUrl` isn’t set, so the URL will keep `?session=...`. That means on every page refresh `applySettingsFromUrl()` will set `sessionFromUrl=true` again, causing `applySessionDefaults()` to *always* skip defaults (the “clear after first connection” behavior only works if the URL param is removed). If the intent is truly “first connection only”, the `session` param likely needs the same cleanup treatment as `token/password/gatewayUrl`.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
