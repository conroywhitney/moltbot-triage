## Description

## Summary
- Add `humanDelay` to WhatsApp's `dispatcherOptions` so block streaming replies respect the configured delay

## Problem
WhatsApp was missing `humanDelay` in `process-message.ts`, causing block streaming to have inconsistent timing based on model generation speed instead of the configured delay (2000-4500ms).

## Changes
- Added `resolveHumanDelayConfig` import from `../../../agents/identity.js`
- Added `humanDelay: resolveHumanDelayConfig(params.cfg, params.route.agentId)` to `dispatcherOptions`

Fixes #2116
