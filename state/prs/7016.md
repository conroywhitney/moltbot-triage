## Description

# Description\nThe new HookConfigSchema only allows 'enabled' and 'env' properties, but the soul-evil hook was expecting additional properties like 'file', 'chance', and 'purge' directly in the hook config.\n\n## Changes\nUpdated resolveSoulEvilConfigFromHook to merge direct properties with env properties to support both old and new configuration styles, maintaining backward compatibility while working with the new schema.\n\n## Testing\n- All existing tests pass (15/15 tests in soul-evil modules)\n- Build succeeds\n- Linting and formatting pass\n- Backward compatibility maintained\n\n## Type of Change\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n\n## Checklist\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\n\n## AI/Vibe-Coded PR\n- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in the PR title or description\n- [x] Note the degree of testing (untested / lightly tested / fully tested) - Fully tested\n- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if possible (super helpful!)\n- [x] Confirm you understand what the code does

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the `soul-evil` hook configuration resolver to support the new `HookConfigSchema` shape by merging top-level config with values provided under `env`, and adds support for a flat env format for purge settings (`purge_at`, `purge_duration`). The bundled hook handler is also updated to pass the hook config through without an unnecessary cast.

The main integration point is `src/hooks/bundled/soul-evil/handler.ts`, which calls `resolveSoulEvilConfigFromHook` before applying `applySoulEvilOverride` to replace `SOUL.md` content during agent bootstrap. The bulk of the behavioral change lives in `src/hooks/soul-evil.ts`, where config parsing now attempts to accept both legacy direct keys (`file`, `chance`, `purge`) and new-schema env-based keys.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but the new config merge logic has edge cases that can mis-handle overrides or throw on malformed config.
- The change is localized and aligns with the stated goal, but `entry.env` is spread without a type guard (can throw at runtime) and the precedence/merge semantics between top-level vs env keys are ambiguous and may not match the intended backward-compat behavior.
- src/hooks/soul-evil.ts
