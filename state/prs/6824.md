## Description

## Summary
Adds null checks for guild.id and guild.name when resolving Discord entities. This prevents TypeError when processing invite links for servers/channels the bot doesn't have cached.

## Changes
- Filter out guilds with missing id/name in `directory-live.ts`
- Add type guard filtering in `resolve-channels.ts` and `resolve-users.ts`
- Updated types to reflect that Discord API may return partial guild data

## Testing
- Verified lint passes (0 errors)
- TypeScript errors are pre-existing in main (pi-tool-definition-adapter.ts)

## Root Cause
Discord API can return guilds with undefined id/name fields for servers the bot doesn't have full access to. Without null checks, this causes TypeError when trying to access .id or .name properties.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR hardens Discord allowlist/directory resolution against partial `/users/@me/guilds` responses by filtering out guild entries missing `id`/`name` before computing slugs or calling guild/channel endpoints. The changes in `resolve-channels.ts` and `resolve-users.ts` correctly model the API as returning optional fields and then narrow via a type-guard filter.

One inconsistency remains in `directory-live.ts`: the guild type is still declared as having required `id`/`name`, so the new runtime filter won’t be reflected in typing and can conceal the actual API contract mismatch (and any related bugs) from TypeScript.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and improves runtime robustness, with a small type-safety inconsistency to address.
- The changes are narrow and defensive (filtering partial guild data) and match the stated root cause. The main concern is `directory-live.ts` still typing guilds as always having `id/name`, which reduces the value of the added checks and could hide future issues from TypeScript, but is unlikely to break runtime behavior.
- src/discord/directory-live.ts (align types with the new runtime filtering)
