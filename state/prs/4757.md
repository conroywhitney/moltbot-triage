## Description

Add automatic discovery of AWS Bedrock inference profiles alongside foundation models. Inference profiles provide cross-region routing and improved availability for Bedrock models.

Changes:
- Add `bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles` API call to discovery process
- Introduce `includeInferenceProfiles` config option (default: true)
- Inference profiles inherit metadata from their base models
- Add separate error handling and logging for profile discovery
- Update documentation with inference profile benefits and usage
- Add permission requirements for inference profile discovery

Inference profiles appear in model listings and can be used interchangeably with base model IDs. Discovery gracefully falls back to base models only if profile discovery fails.
