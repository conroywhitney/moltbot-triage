<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new `zotero` skill documentation file (`skills/zotero/SKILL.md`) describing how to use the `zot` (pyzotero-cli) CLI to search, list, and organize Zotero library items, including setup and common workflows.

Main concern: the frontmatter `metadata` block appears to be malformed (JSON-like with trailing commas), which may prevent the skill from being parsed/loaded depending on how OpenClaw ingests skill frontmatter.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge, but may break skill loading if the frontmatter parser is strict.
- Change is documentation-only, but the SKILL.md frontmatter is likely parsed by tooling; the `metadata` block is not valid YAML/JSON due to trailing commas and JSON-style braces, which could prevent the skill from being discovered/registered.
