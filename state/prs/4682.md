## Description

## Summary
- read SKILL.md with UTF-8 during quick validation to avoid Windows codepage errors
- write new SKILL.md templates with UTF-8 for consistent encoding
- fixes skill packaging failures on GBK locales

## Why this issue happened
- the validator used Path.read_text() without an encoding, so Windows defaulted to GBK and failed on UTF-8 content

## Fix
- force UTF-8 when reading and writing SKILL.md so validation/packaging is locale-independent



Closes #4661

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR makes the skill-creator tooling locale-independent by forcing UTF-8 when reading and writing `SKILL.md`.

- `skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py` now reads `SKILL.md` with `encoding="utf-8"` to avoid Windows/GBK default codepage decode failures during quick validation.
- `skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py` now writes the generated `SKILL.md` template with `encoding="utf-8"` to keep newly-created skills consistent across platforms/locales.

These changes are localized to the skill-creator scripts and shouldn’t affect other parts of the repo beyond improving cross-platform robustness for skill validation/packaging.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Changes are small, well-scoped, and address a concrete cross-platform bug by explicitly setting UTF-8 encoding for a single file read/write path; no behavior changes beyond improved decoding consistency are introduced.
- No files require special attention
