## Description

## Summary
- read SKILL.md with UTF-8 during quick validation to avoid Windows codepage errors
- write new SKILL.md templates with UTF-8 for consistent encoding
- fixes skill packaging failures on GBK locales

## Why this issue happened
- the validator used Path.read_text() without an encoding, so Windows defaulted to GBK and failed on UTF-8 content

## Fix
- force UTF-8 when reading and writing SKILL.md so validation/packaging is locale-independent



Closes #4661
