## Description

### Problem
In Telegram private chats with topics (Bot API 9.3+), async followup sends (routeReply/outbound → sendMessageTelegram) could drop `message_thread_id` when the DM thread id is `1`, because `sendMessageTelegram` always treated thread ids as **forum** scope.

This causes outbound media/documents to land in the main DM window instead of the correct DM topic.

### Fix
- Detect private vs forum chat ids (positive chat id = private chat).
- Build `threadSpec` with scope `dm` for private chats and `forum` otherwise, so `buildTelegramThreadParams` only omits id=1 for forum General topic, but keeps id=1 for DM topics.

### Tests
- Added tests covering DM `message_thread_id=1` for media/doc sends and stickers.
- Added tests ensuring forum General topic id=1 still omits `message_thread_id`.

This should fix delayed media/file replies in DM topics while preserving existing forum behavior.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates Telegram outbound sending to preserve `message_thread_id=1` when sending to DM topics (Bot API 9.3+), while continuing to omit `message_thread_id=1` for forum “General” topic sends. It does this by inferring whether the destination is a private chat vs a forum chat and passing a corresponding `scope` into `buildTelegramThreadParams`, plus adds unit tests covering DM topic `id=1` for documents/media and stickers and forum general-topic omission.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the DM-vs-forum detection and one of the new tests could allow regressions to slip through.
- Core change is small and leverages existing `buildTelegramThreadParams` behavior, but it duplicates chat-id parsing logic in two places and can misclassify non-numeric chat IDs (e.g., `@username`). Additionally, the new “omit message_thread_id” test does not robustly assert absence of the field, reducing confidence that the intended regression is covered.
- src/telegram/send.ts and src/telegram/send.returns-undefined-empty-input.test.ts
