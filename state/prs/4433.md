<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR finishes migrating remaining Clawdbot/Moltbot branding references to OpenClaw across GitHub templates, internal agent workflow docs, skill docs, a tmux helper script, and gitignore entries. It also adds a small CI resilience tweak to skip submodule update when the repo has no `.gitmodules` file.

Overall the changes are low-risk and largely mechanical, but there are a couple of places where the rebrand introduces copy/paste friction (a mis-indented config snippet) or leaves legacy naming behind.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; changes are mostly docs/config with minor workflow/script tweaks.
- Most edits are straightforward text replacements for rebranding. The main risks are around small usability/maintainability issues: a mis-indented JSON5 example in a skill doc and a CI step that exits the job early when `.gitmodules` is missing, which could surprise future additions. No behavioral runtime code changes were introduced.
- skills/sherpa-onnx-tts/SKILL.md, .github/workflows/ci.yml, skills/tmux/scripts/find-sessions.sh
