## Description

### Problem
The gateway currently defaults to `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND=lan`, which causes port `18789` to bind to all LAN interfaces by default.

This means that simply running `docker-compose up` exposes the OpenClaw gateway to the local network without any explicit user intent. In environments such as public Wi-Fi, shared LANs, home routers with UPnP, or misconfigured VPS firewalls, this can unintentionally expose the gateway to untrusted clients.

### Impact
An exposed gateway increases the attack surface and may allow unauthorized access to the OpenClaw API, depending on deployment context and downstream authentication controls. This violates the principle of secure-by-default behavior.

### Solution
Changed the default value of `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND` to `loopback`, ensuring the gateway is only accessible from the host by default.

Users who intentionally require remote or LAN access can still explicitly opt in by setting:
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND=lan`
- or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND=0.0.0.0`

This preserves existing functionality while making the default behavior safer.

## Pull request overview

This PR aims to improve the security defaults for OpenClaw's Docker deployment by restricting the gateway's network binding from LAN-accessible to localhost-only. The intent is to prevent unintentional exposure of the gateway on local networks when users simply run `docker-compose up`.

**Changes:**
- Modified the default value of `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND` from `lan` to `localhost` in docker-compose.yml
