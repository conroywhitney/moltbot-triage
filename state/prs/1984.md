## Description

## Summary
- When `dmScope` is `per-channel-peer` with `identityLinks` configured, linked identities now share context across channels
- Previously the session key always included the channel name even when `identityLinks` resolved to a canonical identity
- Now when a linked identity is found, the channel is omitted from the session key (e.g., `agent:main:dm:alice` instead of `agent:main:discord:dm:alice`)

This now matches the documented behavior:
> per-channel-peer: isolate by channel + sender (recommended for multi-user inboxes). Use session.identityLinks to map provider-prefixed peer ids to a canonical identity so the same person shares a DM session across channels when using per-peer or per-channel-peer.

## Test plan
- [x] Updated existing test expectation
- [x] Added cross-channel test verifying Telegram and Discord routes produce the same session key for linked identities
- [x] Manual testing with gateway restart

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes DM session-key derivation for `dmScope: "per-channel-peer"` when `session.identityLinks` maps the incoming peer to a canonical identity: if a link is found, the generated key omits the channel segment so the same person shares a DM session across channels (e.g. `agent:main:dm:alice` instead of `agent:main:discord:dm:alice`). Tests were updated/extended to cover the new cross-channel behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, with one subtle maintainability concern around how the link/non-link branch is selected.
- The change is small and covered by tests, but the new branching relies on `linkedPeerId` truthiness rather than an explicit “was linked” signal, which could become brittle if normalization rules evolve.
