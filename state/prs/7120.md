## Description

Fixes openclaw#4954.

This adds a default request timeout (30s) to GatewayClient.request() to prevent indefinite hangs and unbounded growth of the pending map during partial disconnects.

Changes:
- new GatewayClientOptions.requestTimeoutMs?: number (default 30_000)
- start a per-request timer that rejects with Gateway request timeout (<method>)
- clear the timer on resolve/reject and when flushing pending errors

Notes:
- requestTimeoutMs=0 disables the timeout (keeps current behavior)
- no behavior change for healthy connections; only affects stuck/in-flight requests

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds an optional per-request timeout to `GatewayClient.request()` (default 30s) and tracks a timer on each pending request so stuck in-flight requests don’t hang indefinitely and grow the pending map. Timers are cleared when a response arrives and when the client flushes pending errors on disconnect/stop.

The changes fit into the existing `pending` request/response correlation mechanism by extending each pending entry with a timer handle and clearing it alongside the existing resolve/reject paths.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge and improves resilience, with a small timer-cleanup issue to address.
- Change is localized to the gateway client request tracking and correctly clears timers on normal response and on flush; the remaining concern is that the timeout callback doesn’t clear its own timer handle, which can keep timers/closures alive unnecessarily under sustained timeouts.
