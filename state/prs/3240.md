<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts Docker build inputs and pnpm workspace configuration to address Docker build failures (notably on Windows/WSL) by: cleaning up `.dockerignore`, adding pnpm workspace peer/workspace linking behavior in `.npmrc`, and copying per-workspace `package.json` files into the Docker build context prior to `pnpm install` so `workspace:*` dependencies can be resolved.

Main concerns are around build determinism: the Docker build now installs with `--no-frozen-lockfile`, which can make dependency resolution drift from the checked-in lockfile, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` contains a duplicated `packages/*` entry suggesting an accidental change.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Moderately safe to merge, but there are a couple correctness/reproducibility concerns to address first.
- Changes are small and localized to build configuration, but `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` can cause non-reproducible dependency resolution in Docker builds, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` includes a duplicated glob that suggests an accidental edit.
- Dockerfile, pnpm-workspace.yaml
