## Description

## Summary

Fix [CWE-400] vulnerability in `extensions/voice-call/src/tunnel.ts`.

**Problem**: `runNgrokCommand()` and `isNgrokAvailable()` spawn ngrok CLI without any timeout. If ngrok binary hangs (network issues, auth stuck), Promise never resolves, causing voice-call functionality to hang indefinitely.

**Impact**: DoS - voice-call operations can hang forever

**Fix**: Add setTimeout + SIGTERM to both functions (same pattern as existing `startNgrokTunnel()`)

## Changes

- `extensions/voice-call/src/tunnel.ts`:
  - `runNgrokCommand()`: Add 30s timeout with SIGTERM
  - `isNgrokAvailable()`: Add 5s timeout with SIGTERM
  - Both include `clearTimeout()` on close/error events

## Testing

- [x] `pnpm format` passes
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- [x] `pnpm test` passes (804 test files, 4969 tests)

## References

- Fixes #6627
- CWE: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds timeouts to ngrok CLI subprocess calls used by the voice-call extension so that `runNgrokCommand()` and `isNgrokAvailable()` don’t hang indefinitely if the ngrok binary stalls. The approach mirrors the existing timeout pattern in `startNgrokTunnel()` by sending SIGTERM after a deadline and cleaning up the timer on process completion/error.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and addresses the reported hang, with a minor race/settlement edge case to consider.
- Change is small and localized, and the new timers are cleared on close/error. Main remaining concern is potential double resolve/reject if timeout and close/error occur concurrently; adding a settled guard would make behavior deterministic.

**`extensions/voice-call/src/tunnel.ts`**
[P1] `runNgrokCommand()` can reject multiple times because the timeout callback doesn’t guard against the child already having exited/errored; similarly, `isNgrokAvailable()` can resolve twice. If `close` fires around the same time as the timeout, you’ll attempt to `reject/resolve` after it’s already settled (and you may send SIGTERM to a PID that already exited). Consider adding a `settled` flag like `startNgrokTunnel()` uses and early-return in each handler/timeout once settled.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
