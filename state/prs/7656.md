## Description

## Summary

Improves the Slack skill documentation based on real-world usage issues encountered when using the skill across different contexts.

## Changes

- **Cross-context limitation warning**: Documents that using `message` tool from Telegram to send to Slack fails with "Cross-context messaging denied", and provides a `curl` workaround
- **Channel ID case sensitivity**: Documents that Slack API requires uppercase channel IDs (e.g., `C03MACCREBA`, not `c03maccreba`)
- **Thread reply support**: Adds examples for replying to threads using `threadId` parameter
- **Reading thread messages**: Documents using `conversations.replies` API since `readMessages` only returns channel-level messages
- **Parameter mapping table**: Adds a reference table mapping Skill parameters to official Slack API parameters
- **Useful API endpoints**: Lists common Slack API endpoints for direct access when the skill doesn't cover a use case
- **Realistic examples**: Uses realistic channel IDs in examples instead of placeholder `C123`

## Motivation

While using the Slack skill, I encountered several issues:
1. Couldn't send messages to Slack from a Telegram session (cross-context limitation)
2. Got `channel_not_found` errors due to channel ID case sensitivity
3. Couldn't figure out how to reply to threads
4. Couldn't read thread replies with `readMessages`

These documentation improvements will help other users avoid the same confusion.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR primarily updates Slack skill documentation with real-world usage notes: cross-context messaging limitations and a direct Slack Web API workaround, channel ID case sensitivity guidance, thread-reply examples, and a parameter mapping/API endpoint reference table. It also adds OpenCode usage notes (free vs paid models, PTY/background examples) to the coding-agent skill docs.

In addition to docs, the PR updates the Google Antigravity-related HTTP `User-Agent` string in both the auth extension and the provider usage fetcher to match a specific `antigravity/<version> <os>/<arch>` format.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; issues are mostly documentation correctness and minor maintainability concerns.
- Changes are primarily documentation updates, with a small header tweak (User-Agent) in two TS files. The main actionable risk is a likely incorrect parameter name in the new Slack thread-reply example (`threadId` vs `threadTs`), which would mislead users. The User-Agent hardcoding is low risk but may be brittle over time.
- skills/slack/SKILL.md (thread reply example); extensions/google-antigravity-auth/index.ts and src/infra/provider-usage.fetch.antigravity.ts (duplicated hardcoded User-Agent).

**`extensions/google-antigravity-auth/index.ts`**
[P2] Hardcoding a specific `User-Agent` string (including version/OS/arch) can become stale quickly and may vary by environment.

If this is intended to emulate a real client, consider centralizing it (shared constant) or deriving OS/arch/version dynamically so future updates don't require touching multiple files (`src/infra/provider-usage.fetch.antigravity.ts:174-179` also sets this UA).
