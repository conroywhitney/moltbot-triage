<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docker-setup.sh` to `chown -R 1000:1000` the host-side config and workspace directories after creating them, aiming to fix Docker installs failing with `EACCES` when the container (running as uid 1000) cannot write to mounted paths (e.g., `.env` under `/home/node/.openclaw`).

The change fits the existing setup flow by ensuring the two directories that are bind-mounted into the gateway/CLI containers are writable before environment variables are exported and compose is run.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Moderately safe to merge, but host UID/GID assumptions may break installs in some environments.
- Change is small and targeted, but hard-coding `1000:1000` and doing recursive ownership changes on host paths can cause failures (due to permissions) or incorrect ownership on systems where the expected UID/GID differs; `set -e` will turn these into immediate setup failures.
- docker-setup.sh
