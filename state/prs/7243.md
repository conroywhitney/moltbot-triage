## Description

## Flaunch Skill 🚀

Adds a new skill for launching memecoins on Base via the Flaunch protocol.

### Features
- **Gasless API** for quick launches (no wallet/ETH needed)
- **SDK integration** for programmatic control with wallet
- **100% fee revenue control** via treasury managers
- **Pre-built managers**: address splits, staking, buybacks
- Verified contract addresses for Base Mainnet and Sepolia

### Setup
Requires `FLAUNCH_CREATOR_ADDRESS` env var.

### Why Flaunch for Agents?
- Agents control 100% of fee earnings (no protocol take)
- Deploy custom treasury managers for any fee distribution logic
- Built-in managers for splits, staking, buybacks
- More flexibility than any other launchpad

### Testing
- [x] Launched token via Gasless API on Base Sepolia
- [x] Launched token via Gasless API on Base Mainnet ([CLAW token](https://flaunch.gg/base/coin/0xe68d316a665ff9af19cdb5fd2e33fcbb065edce5))
- [x] Launched token via SDK on Base Sepolia ([SDKLAUNCH](https://testnet.flaunch.gg/base-sepolia/coin/0x5c741fc9a17d06bbf0b9f99cbe7258d0e5cc2536))
- [x] All contract addresses verified from [official GitHub releases](https://github.com/flayerlabs/flaunchgg-contracts/releases)
- [x] `pnpm check` passes

### Notes
- Uses Flaunch's public gasless API at `web2-api.flaunch.gg`
- SDK requires `@flaunch/sdk` and `viem` packages
- Fair launch is deprecated—documentation reflects this

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new `skills/flaunch/SKILL.md` skill document describing how to launch memecoins on Base using Flaunch, including gasless API flows, SDK usage, treasury manager concepts, and a table of verified contract addresses for mainnet/testnet.

The change fits into the repo’s skill system by providing a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name/description/homepage/metadata) plus usage documentation intended to be consumed by the skill loader and/or rendered for users.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Reasonably safe to merge, but frontmatter parsing likely breaks skill registration.
- Only a single documentation/skill file is added, so blast radius is low, but the YAML frontmatter appears invalid (JSON object with trailing commas), which can cause the skill system to fail to parse/recognize the skill.
- skills/flaunch/SKILL.md
