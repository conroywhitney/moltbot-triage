## Description

### Problem
- Telegram forum topics can show "This command is not available" for slash commands unless bot commands are registered for group scope.
- Some auth/diagnostic command responses could be sent without `message_thread_id` and land in the General topic.

### Fix
- Register Telegram bot commands with both default scope and `all_group_chats` scope via `setMyCommands`.
- Ensure auth/diagnostic `sendMessage` responses in `resolveTelegramCommandAuth` include correct forum topic thread params (omitting General topic id=1 as required).
- Ensure plugin-command "Command not found" message also preserves topic thread params.

### Tests
- Updated `src/telegram/bot-native-commands.test.ts` to assert `setMyCommands` is called with `all_group_chats` scope.
- Ran: `pnpm vitest run src/telegram/bot-native-commands.test.ts`

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates Telegram native command handling in two ways: (1) it registers bot commands for both the default scope and the `all_group_chats` scope to avoid Telegram forum-topic clients showing “This command is not available”, and (2) it preserves forum topic routing (via `message_thread_id`, omitting General topic id=1) for auth/diagnostic and “Command not found” replies so responses stay in the invoking topic.

The changes are localized to `src/telegram/bot-native-commands.ts`, with a small test update in `src/telegram/bot-native-commands.test.ts` to cover the added group-scope registration behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with one functional follow-up needed to keep command scopes consistent when disabling commands.
- Changes are small and targeted (adding thread params to a few sendMessage calls and registering commands in an additional Telegram scope). Main risk is behavioral inconsistency: group-scoped commands may remain registered if native commands are later disabled, since the disable path only clears the default scope.

## Comments

### @dae-sun (2026-02-01)

Addressed Greptile review notes:
- When native commands are explicitly disabled, we now clear *both* default scope and  scope via  to avoid stale group-scoped commands lingering.
- Tightened test to assert both default-scope and  registrations are present.

Re-ran: undefined
