## Description

## Problem

When using the Chrome extension relay (`profile=chrome`), Playwright's `connectOverCDP()` initializes pages with `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` defaulting `prefers-color-scheme` to `light` — a hardcoded fallback in Playwright's `page.ts` (line 419: `contextOptions.colorScheme ?? "light"`). This overrides the user's OS/browser dark mode preference and **persists after the operation completes**.

### Steps to reproduce
1. User has their browser/OS in dark mode
2. Agent takes a screenshot or snapshot via Chrome extension relay
3. The tab flips to light mode and **stays that way**

### Root cause trace
- `connectOverCDP()` → `observeBrowser()` → page `_initialize()` → `_updateEmulateMedia()`
- `emulatedMedia().colorScheme` resolves to `contextOptions.colorScheme ?? "light"`
- Since the context was not created by Playwright (it's an existing Chrome context), `contextOptions.colorScheme` is `undefined`
- Playwright sends `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` with `prefers-color-scheme: light` to Chrome
- Chrome overrides the OS preference; the override persists even after Playwright disconnects

## Fix

For extension relay profiles (`driver=extension`), clear the `prefers-color-scheme` override via a direct CDP call before screenshot/snapshot operations. Sending an empty string (`""`) for the feature value tells Chrome to stop overriding and use the system default.

### Changes
- **`pw-tools-core.state.ts`**: New `clearMediaEmulationOverrideViaPlaywright()` function that sends `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` with empty `prefers-color-scheme` via CDP session
- **`agent.snapshot.ts`**: Call the clear function before screenshot and snapshot operations, only for `driver=extension` profiles
- **`pw-ai.ts`**: Export the new function

### Scope
- Only affects extension relay profiles (`driver=extension`). Managed browser profiles are unchanged.
- No breaking changes. Existing behavior preserved when no extension relay is used.
- Error-safe: the clear call is wrapped in `.catch(() => {})` so failures don't block operations.

Fixes #6167

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a CDP-based workaround for Chrome extension relay (`driver=extension`) sessions where Playwright’s `connectOverCDP()` applies a persistent `prefers-color-scheme: light` emulation. It introduces `clearMediaEmulationOverrideViaPlaywright()` (sending `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` with an empty `prefers-color-scheme` value) and calls it before screenshot and snapshot operations to restore the user’s system/browser color scheme.


<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and narrowly scoped, with minor behavioral edge cases to verify around CDP emulation state.
- The change is small and gated to extension relay profiles, and the workaround aligns with the described Playwright/Chrome behavior. Main risk is unintended side effects from the `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` payload potentially resetting other emulation fields, plus silent error swallowing making failures hard to detect.
- src/browser/pw-tools-core.state.ts; src/browser/routes/agent.snapshot.ts
