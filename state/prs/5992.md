## Description

## Summary
When `/think` and `/status` were used in the same message (directive-only path), `/status` still showed the previous thinking level (e.g. "low") instead of the level just set by `/think`. This made it look like the `/think` command wasn’t applied, especially with reasoning-capable models like Gemini.

## Changes
- In the directive-only reply path, status now uses `effectiveThinkLevel` (directive + session + default) when building the status reply, so the reported think level matches what is actually in effect after applying `/think`.
- Ensures the status line reflects the level set by `/think` in the same message, not the pre-directive default.

## Testing
- `reply.directive.directive-behavior.returns-status-alongside-directive-only-acks.e2e.test.ts` covers the combined `/think` + `/status` behavior.
- Manual: send `/think high` and `/status` in one message; status should show "Think: high".

Fixes #5919

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes `/status` in the directive-only path to report the *effective* thinking level when `/think` and `/status` are used in the same message. It adds an E2E test covering `/think high\n/status` and updates `applyInlineDirectiveOverrides` to compute `effectiveThinkLevel` (directive → session → default) and pass it into `buildStatusReply`, so status reflects the newly applied `/think` value.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the change to `resolveDefaultThinkingLevel` could subtly affect status semantics depending on how `buildStatusReply` uses it.
- The functional change is small and well-covered by a new E2E test for the reported bug. However, repurposing a callback named `resolveDefaultThinkingLevel` to return an overridden/effective value may create incorrect status output in other scenarios if `buildStatusReply` relies on it to compute or display defaults.
- src/auto-reply/reply/get-reply-directives-apply.ts (check how `buildStatusReply` interprets `resolveDefaultThinkingLevel`).
