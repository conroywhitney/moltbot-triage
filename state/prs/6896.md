## Description

Adds `scripts/copy-templates.ts`, integrates it into the build, and adds workspace template resolution along with tests.

Split from original combined PR #6888 into a focused change.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a build-time `copy-templates` script and updates workspace bootstrap logic to locate template files across several runtime layouts, with new tests covering template resolution and copying.

Key integration points are:
- `package.json` wiring the new script into `pnpm build`.
- `src/agents/workspace.ts` loading workspace bootstrap templates and writing default files.
- New vitest coverage for both the workspace bootstrap path and the copy script.

Main issues found are around ESM compatibility (`require.main` in an ESM repo), and duplicated template-directory resolution logic that can drift from the existing `resolveWorkspaceTemplateDir` implementation.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is due to a likely runtime failure when executing the new build script under ESM.
- The new `scripts/copy-templates.ts` uses `require.main === module`, which will throw in an ESM context and break `pnpm build`. Other findings are lower severity but may cause inconsistent template resolution or test/import fragility.
- scripts/copy-templates.ts, src/agents/workspace.ts, src/scripts/copy-templates.test.ts
