## Description

- Extract sqlite-vec loading and vector table lifecycle to VectorManager class
- Move ~70 lines of vector logic from manager.ts to vector/vector-manager.ts
- manager.ts delegates vector operations to VectorManager instance
- Zero breaking changes to public API
- All existing tests should pass

Part of memory modularization effort to reduce manager.ts complexity (2179 → 2107 lines)
