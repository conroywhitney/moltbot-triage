## Description

## Summary

Adds [Quotio](https://www.quotio.dev) as a first-class provider option in the `moltbot onboard` wizard.

**What is Quotio?**
Quotio is a native macOS menu bar app that unifies your AI subscriptions (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Qwen, Antigravity) with real-time quota tracking and smart auto-failover. It runs a local OpenAI-compatible proxy that AI coding tools can connect to.

## Features

### Zero-Config Setup
- **Auto-detects** Quotio's config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Quotio/config.yaml`)
- Reads `host`, `port`, and `api-keys` directly from the config
- Falls back to environment variables (`QUOTIO_BASE_URL`, `QUOTIO_API_KEY`)
- Probes default endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:18317/v1`) automatically

### Model Discovery & Selection
- Fetches available models from Quotio's `/models` endpoint
- User selects their preferred default model from discovered list
- All discovered models are configured in moltbot

### Graceful Fallbacks
- If auto-detection fails, prompts for manual URL/API key entry
- Shows helpful message with download link to quotio.dev
- Handles connection errors with clear user feedback

## Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/commands/onboard-types.ts` - Added `quotio` to `AuthChoice` type
- `src/commands/auth-choice-options.ts` - Added Quotio group and option
- `src/commands/auth-choice.preferred-provider.ts` - Added provider mapping
- `src/commands/auth-choice.apply.ts` - Registered Quotio handler

**Files Created:**
- `src/commands/auth-choice.apply.quotio.ts` - Complete handler with:
  - Config file reading (YAML parsing)
  - Environment variable detection
  - Endpoint probing
  - Model discovery from `/models` API
  - Interactive model selection
  - Provider configuration

## Testing

Build passes. Manual testing recommended with Quotio running.

```bash
pnpm build
node dist/entry.js onboard --auth-choice quotio
```
