## Description

The system prompt now displays the full formatted time including the day of week (e.g., "Current time: Monday, January 5th, 2026 — 3:26 PM (America/Chicago)") instead of just showing the timezone.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the system prompt’s “Current Date & Time” section to include the fully formatted current time (optionally supplied via `params.userTime`) alongside the user’s timezone, while preserving the previous behavior of showing only the timezone when no formatted time is provided. Tests were adjusted to assert the new “Current time: … (TZ)” output for both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is small, additive, and gated behind existing `userTimezone` presence; it preserves prior output when `userTime` is not provided, and the updated tests cover both 12-hour and 24-hour cases plus the fallback timezone-only case.
- No files require special attention
