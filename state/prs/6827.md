## Description

fix #6814

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds startup cleanup for orphaned `*.tmp` cron store files (left behind by interrupted `saveCronStore` writes) by introducing `cleanupOrphanedTempFiles(storePath)` in `src/cron/store.ts` and calling it from `ensureLoaded()` before reading the cron jobs store.

The change fits the existing persistence approach in `src/cron/store.ts` where writes are done via a temp file + rename; this adds a best-effort guard to prevent old temp artifacts from accumulating across runs (fixing #6814).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge; it adds best-effort temp-file cleanup with low blast radius.
- Changes are small and localized, but there is a plausible behavioral gap where cleanup is skipped on the in-memory cache fast-path, and the cleanup function fully suppresses errors which could hide operational problems.
- src/cron/service/store.ts (cleanup call placement), src/cron/store.ts (error visibility during cleanup)

**`src/cron/service/store.ts`**
[P1] Cleanup is skipped when store is served from cache

`ensureLoaded` returns early if `storeCache` has an entry, so `cleanupOrphanedTempFiles()` never runs in that (valid) startup path. If #6814 can occur even when the in-memory cache is populated (e.g., multiple `CronServiceState`s in one process using the same `storePath`, or a long-lived process re-initializing state after a crash), stale `*.tmp` files will remain. Consider running cleanup before the cache fast-path, or doing it once per `storePath` (e.g., separate "cleanup done" set).
