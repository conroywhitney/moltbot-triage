## Description

Remove the && !textLike condition from the audio skip logic in extractFileBlocks(). OGG/Opus files often contain printable headers that cause looksLikeUtf8Text() to return true, leading to incorrect MIME type detection (e.g., text/csv) and binary garbage being included as file blocks.

If the attachment kind is audio, skip it unconditionally rather than checking byte content.

Fixes #6069

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes `extractFileBlocks()` in `src/media-understanding/apply.ts` so attachments classified as `audio` are skipped unconditionally (unless a forced text MIME is already resolved). This prevents OGG/Opus files with text-like headers from being misdetected as text (e.g., `text/csv`) and included as binary garbage in extracted file blocks.

The change is localized to the media-understanding pipeline and narrows behavior only for `audio` kinds, reducing false-positive text classification.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Single-line logic change that directly addresses the reported misclassification; no new APIs or broader refactors involved, and control flow remains straightforward.
- No files require special attention
