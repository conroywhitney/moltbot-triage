## Description

Fixes #4707

## Problem
When the  CLI encounters errors (e.g., permission denied accessing chat.db), it outputs plain-text error messages to stdout instead of properly formatted JSON-RPC responses. This causes the RPC client to fail parsing and log overwhelming error messages like:

```
msg rpc: failed to parse permissionDenied(path: "/Users/.../chat.db", underlying: authorization denied (code: 23)): Unexpected token 'p', "permission"... is not valid JSON
```

## Solution
This fix improves error handling in the RPC client:
- Adds explanatory comments about why non-JSON output can occur
- Truncates long lines in error messages (max 200 chars) to prevent log spam
- Improves error message clarity: "received non-JSON output" instead of "failed to parse"
- Removes unused error detail variable

## Testing
- Linter passed with no errors
- Change is backward compatible (only affects error handling)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `IMessageRpcClient`'s stdout line handling to better cope with cases where the `imsg rpc` CLI prints plain-text errors to stdout instead of JSON-RPC. In `src/imessage/client.ts`, parse failures now produce a clearer log message and the logged line is truncated to avoid log spam, while removing an unused error-detail variable.

This fits into the existing client flow where stdout is treated as a JSON-RPC stream (`handleLine`) and stderr is already logged line-by-line; the change only affects how stdout parse errors are reported and does not alter request/response handling for valid JSON-RPC frames.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with low risk; it only changes logging/error reporting around stdout parse failures.
- The change is localized to `handleLine`’s JSON.parse error path and does not affect normal JSON-RPC request/response routing. Main remaining concern is reduced diagnosability because the parse error is swallowed, but functionality should be unchanged for valid JSON.
- src/imessage/client.ts (only for log/debuggability expectations)

**`src/imessage/client.ts`**
[P1] Swallowing the JSON.parse error makes debugging harder when the output is *almost* JSON (e.g., truncated JSON-RPC frames).

Right now the `catch { ... }` discards the parser error entirely, so logs lose the position/reason ("Unexpected token ...") that can be useful even when you truncate the payload. Consider keeping a short, safe detail like `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` and logging it alongside the truncated line.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
