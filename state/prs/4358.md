## Description

## Problem

iMessage (and likely other channel) responses have 1-2 blank lines prepended before the actual text content when using extended thinking mode.

## Root Cause

Anthropic models in extended thinking mode emit a `\n\n` text content block **before** the thinking block. The streaming/block-flush path preserves these leading newlines because:

1. `emitBlockChunk()` in `pi-embedded-subscribe.ts` uses `.trimEnd()` instead of `.trim()` — preserves leading newlines
2. `collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks()` in `pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts` returns the original untrimmed text when there's only one paragraph block (early return `if (blocks.length < 2) return text;`)
3. `sanitizeUserFacingText()` doesn't trim the final output

The final payloads path (`extractAssistantText()`) is NOT affected because it trims individual content blocks and filters empties.

## Fixes (defense in depth)

1. **`emitBlockChunk`**: `.trimEnd()` → `.trim()` — stops leading newlines at the source
2. **`collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks`**: early return now returns `trimmed` instead of `text` — fixes the sanitizer
3. **`sanitizeUserFacingText`**: added `.trim()` to final return — safety net for all paths

## Testing

- Verified compiled JS reflects all three changes
- No behavior change for well-formed text (already trimmed)
- Only affects text with leading whitespace, which should never be user-facing
