## Description

## Problem

iMessage (and likely other channel) responses have 1-2 blank lines prepended before the actual text content when using extended thinking mode.

## Root Cause

Anthropic models in extended thinking mode emit a `\n\n` text content block **before** the thinking block. The streaming/block-flush path preserves these leading newlines because:

1. `emitBlockChunk()` in `pi-embedded-subscribe.ts` uses `.trimEnd()` instead of `.trim()` — preserves leading newlines
2. `collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks()` in `pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts` returns the original untrimmed text when there's only one paragraph block (early return `if (blocks.length < 2) return text;`)
3. `sanitizeUserFacingText()` doesn't trim the final output

The final payloads path (`extractAssistantText()`) is NOT affected because it trims individual content blocks and filters empties.

## Fixes (defense in depth)

1. **`emitBlockChunk`**: `.trimEnd()` → `.trim()` — stops leading newlines at the source
2. **`collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks`**: early return now returns `trimmed` instead of `text` — fixes the sanitizer
3. **`sanitizeUserFacingText`**: added `.trim()` to final return — safety net for all paths

## Testing

- Verified compiled JS reflects all three changes
- No behavior change for well-formed text (already trimmed)
- Only affects text with leading whitespace, which should never be user-facing

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR addresses a user-facing formatting bug where some streaming/block-flush reply paths could prepend blank lines (e.g., Anthropic extended thinking emitting an initial `\n\n` text block). The change trims leading whitespace earlier in the streaming path (`emitBlockChunk` now uses `.trim()`), and adds defense-in-depth trimming in the sanitizer (`sanitizeUserFacingText` now trims final output) plus a fix to avoid returning untrimmed content in a short-circuit path of `collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks`.

Overall, the approach fits the codebase’s existing “sanitize at boundaries” patterns in the embedded Pi streaming pipeline: raw provider output is cleaned before being stored/emitted, and final UI-facing strings are sanitized again.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with one small logic edge case to address to fully achieve the intended trimming behavior.
- Changes are localized string-sanitization adjustments in the embedded streaming pipeline. The main potential issue is that `collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks` can still return the original untrimmed `text` when it decides nothing changed, which can reintroduce leading newlines and partially negate the fix in certain paths.

**`src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts`**
[P1] `collapseConsecutiveDuplicateBlocks` still returns the *untrimmed* original `text` in one important case.

Right now the function trims into `trimmed`, but if no duplicates were removed you return `text` (`if (result.length === blocks.length) return text;`). That reintroduces leading `\n\n` (and any other leading/trailing whitespace) even after your early-return fix. If the goal is to consistently drop user-facing leading newlines, this should likely return `trimmed` (or otherwise ensure it doesn’t undo trimming).

Also appears at `src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts:117-120`.
