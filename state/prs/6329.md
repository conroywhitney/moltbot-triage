## Description

## Problem

The signal-cli installer was downloading and attempting to use x86-64 native binaries on all Linux systems, causing "exec format error" on ARM64 platforms like Raspberry Pi.

## Solution

This PR adds architecture detection to select the appropriate signal-cli release:
- **ARM64/aarch64/arm**: Downloads the JAR version (platform-independent)
- **x86_64**: Continues using native binaries for optimal performance

## Technical Details

The JAR version includes all necessary native libraries (libsignal-client) and works reliably across all architectures when paired with the system's Java runtime.

## Testing

Tested on:
- Raspberry Pi (aarch64) - Successfully downloads and runs JAR version
- Should maintain existing behavior on x86_64 systems

## Related Issues

Fixes installation issues on Raspberry Pi and other ARM64 Linux systems where users encountered:
```
zsh: exec format error: ./signal-cli
```

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This change updates the signal-cli installer to select different release assets on Linux based on CPU architecture: ARM platforms prefer the platform-independent archive (avoiding x86_64 native binaries), while x86_64 continues to prefer `linux-native` for performance. The selection happens in `pickAsset` and feeds into the existing download/extract/install flow used by Signal onboarding.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, with one correctness concern in the ARM architecture detection logic.
- The change is localized to asset selection and keeps existing Linux/x86 behavior, but the `os.arch()` check includes a non-returned value (`"aarch64"`) and may not cover all ARM variants, which could still lead to selecting native binaries on some ARM systems.
