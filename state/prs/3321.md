## Description

## Summary

Fixes #2393

Add the following OpenAI TTS voices to the `OPENAI_TTS_VOICES` allowlist:
- ballad
- cedar
- marin
- verse

These voices are listed in OpenAI's `/audio/speech` API reference but were missing from the main TTS module. The `extensions/voice-call` module already had these voices; this PR syncs `src/tts/tts.ts` to match.

**Note:** `juniper` mentioned in the issue is a ChatGPT app-only voice and is not available via the TTS API, so it is intentionally not included.

## Test plan
- [ ] CI tests pass (the existing `isValidOpenAIVoice` test iterates over `OPENAI_TTS_VOICES`)
- [ ] Verify new voices work by configuring `messages.tts.openai.voice: "cedar"`
