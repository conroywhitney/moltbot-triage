## Description

This PR will add integration for the [Puter AI API](https://developer.puter.com/ai/), allowing users to access 500+ models without having to set up their own API keys.

[Puter](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter/) is an open-source cloud operating system allowing users to bring their own resources to apps hence removing the need for API keys. You can think of it as "OAuth for everything!".

Setup process on onboarding demo:

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds Puter as an onboarding auth provider option (web login or manual API key), wires it into preferred-provider selection, and introduces Puter model/provider config helpers so users can select a Puter-backed model without bringing their own third-party model keys.

Main integration points are the onboarding auth-choice flows (`auth-choice-options.ts`, `auth-choice.apply.api-providers.ts`, and config builders in `onboard-auth.*`). It also updates CLI help text for `openclaw onboard --auth-choice` to include the new Puter options.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is due to a localhost callback-token injection issue and a broken non-interactive Puter path.
   - **Non issue and not a vulnerability as a bad token does not compromise your system or AI responses in any way**
- The Puter web login flow accepts a token from any localhost request without a state/nonce, which can allow local token 
   - **Re-Above**
- injection during the auth window. Additionally, `puter-api-key` isn’t implemented for non-interactive onboarding, so the advertised CLI option won’t work there. Other concerns are lower-severity (UX prompting behavior, questionable default model id).
    - **FIXED**
- src/commands/auth-choice.apply.api-providers.ts, src/commands/onboard-non-interactive/local/auth-choice.ts, src/commands/onboard-auth.models.ts

[P0] Non-interactive flow never supports Puter API key

This file treats `puter-web` as OAuth-only and errors in non-interactive mode, but there’s no corresponding `puter-api-key` branch anywhere above. As a result, `--non-interactive --auth-choice puter-api-key` won’t be handled and will silently fall through to the default return, leaving Puter unconfigured.
