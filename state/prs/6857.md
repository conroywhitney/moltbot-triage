## Description

## Summary

The slash-commands quick reference and system prompt didn't explicitly mention that `on` and `ask` are equivalent for `/elevated`. This caused confusion — agents (and users) couldn't determine what `on` does without consulting the source code or the dedicated elevated.md doc.

## Changes

- **docs/tools/slash-commands.md**: Add note that `on` is an alias for `ask` in the command list
- **src/agents/system-prompt.ts**: Update the elevated explanation from "ask runs exec..." to "on/ask run exec..."

## Context

Discovered while testing: an OpenClaw agent was asked what `/elevated on` does, and it couldn't answer definitively because its system prompt only explained `ask` and `full`, not `on`.

The source code shows:
```typescript
export function resolveElevatedMode(level?: ElevatedLevel | null): ElevatedMode {
  if (!level || level === "off") return "off";
  if (level === "full") return "full";
  return "ask";  // "on" maps here
}
```

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the slash-commands quick reference and the agent system prompt to explicitly state that `/elevated on` behaves the same as `/elevated ask`, reducing ambiguity for both users and agents when toggling elevated exec behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it only clarifies documentation/system prompt wording.
- Changes are small, localized, and purely textual (docs + system prompt string), with no behavioral impact on code paths.
- No files require special attention
