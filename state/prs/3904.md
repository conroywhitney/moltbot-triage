## Description

## Summary

Fixes #1989

OGG audio files (used by Telegram voice messages as OGG Opus) were being misidentified as `text/tab-separated-values` because their ASCII-heavy headers passed `looksLikeUtf8Text()`. This caused:
- Audio binary embedded as text in session → token overflow (208K > 200K limit)
- Agent unable to respond to voice-only messages
- Session file rapid growth (2.3MB+)

## Root Cause

The `looksLikeUtf8Text()` function checks if >85% of sampled bytes are printable ASCII. OGG files pass this check because:
1. OGG header starts with "OggS" (ASCII printable)
2. Vorbis/Opus comment metadata contains extensive ASCII text (ENCODER=, TITLE=, etc.)
3. Metadata often uses tab characters as separators → `guessDelimitedMime()` returns TSV

## Solution

Add `hasBinaryAudioMagic()` to detect binary audio formats by their **magic bytes** (file signatures), which provides authoritative format detection independent of MIME type or file extension.

### Supported Formats

| Format | Magic Bytes | Specification |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| OGG container | `OggS` (0x4F 0x67 0x67 0x53) | [RFC 3533 Section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3533#section-6) |
| MP3 with ID3v2 | `ID3` (0x49 0x44 0x33) | [id3.org spec Section 3.1](https://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure) |

The `textLike` check now excludes files with known binary audio signatures:

```typescript
const textLike =
  (Boolean(utf16Charset) || looksLikeUtf8Text(bufferResult?.buffer)) &&
  !hasBinaryAudioMagic(bufferResult?.buffer);
```

## Test Plan

- [x] All existing tests pass (4840 tests)
- [x] Added regression test for OGG with ASCII-heavy headers
- [x] Added regression test for MP3 with ID3 tag
- [x] Format check passes (`pnpm format`)
- [x] Manual: Telegram voice message triggers transcription
