## Description

## Summary

This PR fixes the Docker build failure reported in #2593.

### Problem

Docker builds failed because `.dockerignore` excluded directories required during the A2UI bundling step:

- `apps/shared/ClawdbotKit/Tools/CanvasA2UI`
- `vendor/a2ui/renderers/lit`

This caused `pnpm build` to fail with missing file errors during Docker builds.

### Root Cause

The `.dockerignore` file ignored the entire `apps/` and `vendor/` directories, preventing required shared assets from being copied into the Docker build context.

### Fix

- Removed blanket ignores for `apps/` and `vendor/`.
- Ignored only platform-specific directories (`apps/android`, `apps/ios`, `apps/macos`).
- Ensured required shared build assets remain available during Docker builds.

### Result

- Docker build now succeeds.
- A2UI bundling works correctly.
- Build context remains optimized without excluding required files.

### Verification

Tested locally with:

```bash
docker build -t clawdbot-test .

Hi sorry, I still face this problem when i am trying to install from docker (in GCP), is this changes live?

### @HA2345567 (2026-01-28)

@s92225 
The fix is in this PR but it hasn’t been merged yet, so it’s not included in Docker builds or releases. Once the CI issues are resolved and the PR is merged, it should work in Docker as well.
