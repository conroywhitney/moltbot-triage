## Description

Interactive HTML visualization with:
- 3 balancing algorithms (Largest Candidate Time, Ranked Positional Weight, Kilbridge & Wester)
- Animated step-by-step station merging
- Bar chart with stacked task segments and takt line
- Gantt timeline view per station
- Efficiency gauge and KPI dashboard
- Full process detail table with station assignments
- Adjustable station count, algorithm, and animation speed

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new self-contained `cable-assembly-line-balancing.html` page implementing an interactive line-balancing visualization for a Double End M12 Cable Assembly. The page includes UI controls for choosing target station count, algorithm, and animation speed; renders a stacked workload bar chart with a bottleneck/takt line, a per-station Gantt timeline, an efficiency gauge, KPI cards, and a detailed process table. Balancing is implemented in-client via three selectable heuristics and animated by generating intermediate “merge” snapshots before updating the final station assignment.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge, but some algorithm labeling/behavior and snapshot animation failure modes may mislead users.
- The change is isolated to a new HTML file and is unlikely to affect the rest of the repo. Main concerns are correctness/expectations: the ‘RPW’ and ‘Kilbridge & Wester’ implementations assume linear precedence and/or don’t match the named method, and `buildSnapshots()` can silently skip merges, causing confusing animations. There are also a few edge-case math guards and minor accessibility gaps.
