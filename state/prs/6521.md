<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts mobile chat layout styles to prevent overflow in the split-view chat UI and improve the compose area layout on small screens.

- `ui/src/styles/chat/sidebar.css` adds a mobile (≤768px) override to allow `.chat-main` to shrink (`min-width: 0`), which helps prevent overflow when the sidebar/split layout is present.
- `ui/src/styles/layout.mobile.css` updates the compose row on small screens (≤600px) to stack textarea + actions vertically and align the action buttons to the end, keeping the send button readable and avoiding wrap/overflow.

These changes build on the existing chat layout in `ui/src/styles/chat/layout.css` and the `.chat-main` split container logic in `ui/src/ui/views/chat.ts`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is limited to small, scoped CSS overrides that align with established flexbox patterns (min-width: 0 for flex children and mobile stacking). No JS/TS logic changes, and selectors match existing DOM structure (`chat.ts`) and base styles (`chat/layout.css`).
- No files require special attention
