## Description

[When you switch models via /models, the footer was still showing the old provider name instead of updating to show what you just selected. This was confusing because the token stats were live but the model name was stuck on the default.](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/3043)
Closes #3043 

The issue was that the footer reads from the session list, which only looked at model/modelProvider fields (set after agent runs). When you manually switch models, it actually sets providerOverride/modelOverride instead, so we need to resolve the effective model considering those overrides.
