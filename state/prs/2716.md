## Description

Fix #2678 markdown horizontal rule rendering in web chat

Ensure --- / *** / ___ are recognized as thematic breaks and add regression test.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR attempts to fix missing markdown thematic breaks in the web chat UI by preprocessing message markdown in `ui/src/ui/chat/grouped-render.ts` (wrapping exact `---` / `***` / `___` lines with newlines before calling `toSanitizedMarkdownHtml`). It also adds a regression test in `ui/src/ui/markdown.test.ts` asserting that `toSanitizedMarkdownHtml` can produce an `<hr>` for an input containing `---`.

The change sits at the UI rendering layer (Lit templates) and feeds into the shared markdown sanitizer/renderer (`ui/src/ui/markdown.ts`, which uses `marked` + DOMPurify).

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Likely safe to merge, but may not fully fix the reported rendering bug in all real-world cases.
- Changes are small and localized, but the newline-padding logic is narrowly scoped (exact matches only) and the added test doesn’t exercise the actual UI preprocessing path, so there’s a meaningful chance the reported issue persists for common inputs/variants.
- ui/src/ui/chat/grouped-render.ts (thematic break preprocessing) and ui/src/ui/markdown.test.ts (test coverage for variants/UI path)
