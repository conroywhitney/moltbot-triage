<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates GitHub issue templates to reflect the project rename by replacing user-facing references to “Clawdbot” with “OpenClaw” in the bug report and feature request templates, plus the issue template configuration contact link copy. These changes affect only `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` and adjust the wording shown to users when opening issues.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; changes are limited to GitHub issue templates.
- Edits are straightforward string substitutions in markdown/yaml templates with no impact on runtime code paths. Only minor risk is user-facing wording pointing to outdated community/support naming.
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml
