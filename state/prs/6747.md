## Description

## Summary

SVG icons inside `.callout` elements were rendering incorrectly - appearing as filled black shapes instead of stroked outlines.

This caused the compaction indicator checkmark to appear as a **black triangle** on the green success background:

**Before:** Green box with black filled triangle (broken)
**After:** Green box with properly stroked checkmark ✓

## Root Cause

The `.btn svg` selector has proper styling:
```css
.btn svg {
  stroke: currentColor;
  fill: none;
  stroke-width: 1.5px;
  ...
}
```

But `.callout svg` had **no styling**, so SVGs defaulted to:
- `fill: black` (browser default)
- `stroke: none`

## Changes

Added matching SVG styling for callout icons in `components.css`.

## Test plan

- [ ] Trigger context compaction in web UI
- [ ] Verify "Context compacted" shows a green checkmark (not black triangle)
- [ ] Verify "Compacting context..." shows the loader icon correctly

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes incorrect SVG rendering inside `.callout` elements by adding explicit `stroke: currentColor` / `fill: none` styling so callout icons (e.g., the compaction success checkmark) render as stroked outlines instead of default filled black shapes.

While reviewing the broader changes included in the diff, I also noticed unrelated UI behavior changes that may be unintentional: the chat tool card UI now relies on heuristic command classification (which can mislabel security levels), and the favicon path was changed to a relative URL which can break on nested routes depending on how the UI is hosted.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but includes a couple of potentially user-visible regressions unrelated to the SVG fix.
- The core CSS change for `.callout svg` is low risk and addresses the reported rendering issue. However, additional changes in the PR affect UI behavior (tool card display/classification and favicon path resolution) and could cause confusion or broken asset loading in some deployments, which lowers merge confidence.
