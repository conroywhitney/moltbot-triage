## Description

### Background

The current macOS VM setup guide assumes that running:

```bash
lume create openclaw --os macos --ipsw latest
```

will always open a VNC window automatically so users can complete the macOS Setup Assistant.

In practice, this does not always happen.

---

### What’s changed

This PR adds a short clarification note explaining how to manually open the VNC display when it does not start automatically.

Specifically, it documents the use of:

```bash
lume run openclaw
```

to explicitly start the VM with a display and open the VNC window.

It also briefly mentions `--no-display` for users who intentionally want to run the VM headless.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Updates the macOS VM (Lume) setup guide to note that the VNC window may not always open automatically after `lume create`, and documents using `lume run openclaw` to manually start the VM with a display. Also mentions `--no-display` for users who want headless operation. This fits into the existing step-by-step Lume flow in `docs/platforms/macos-vm.md` by clarifying the display/VNC behavior at VM creation time.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Only documentation changes; no code paths are affected. The guidance appears consistent with the existing Lume workflow in the doc, with the main review note being formatting/Markdown readability.
- No files require special attention
