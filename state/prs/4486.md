## Description

### Background

The current macOS VM setup guide assumes that running:

```bash
lume create openclaw --os macos --ipsw latest
```

will always open a VNC window automatically so users can complete the macOS Setup Assistant.

In practice, this does not always happen.

### What’s changed

This PR adds a short clarification note explaining how to manually open the VNC display when it does not start automatically.

Specifically, it documents the use of:

```bash
lume run openclaw
```

to explicitly start the VM with a display and open the VNC window.

It also briefly mentions `--no-display` for users who intentionally want to run the VM headless.
