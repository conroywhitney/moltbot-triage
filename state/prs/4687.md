## Description

## Summary

Add a new skill for generating charts and data visualizations using Python matplotlib via `uv run`.

## Features

- 📈 **Line charts** — time series, trends
- 📊 **Bar charts** — comparisons, rankings
- 🥧 **Pie charts** — distributions, proportions
- 📉 **Dual-line charts** — A/B comparisons
- 🗓️ **Heatmaps** — calendar views, matrices
- 📁 **JSON data loading** — integrate with any data source

## Why This Skill?

Charts are essential for data analysis, reporting, and monitoring. This skill enables Clawdbot to:
- Visualize alert trends and patterns
- Create reports with embedded charts
- Analyze data visually before diving into details
- Generate professional-looking graphs for sharing

## Implementation

Uses `uv run --with matplotlib` for **zero-install** Python charting:
- No pip install needed
- Works immediately on any system with `uv`
- Dark theme optimized for chat interfaces

## Test Results

Tested with real-world data: TDA Alertmanager alerts from January 2026.

### Test 1: Dual-Line Trend Chart

Generated a trend chart showing Alertmanager vs Opsgenie alerts over 30 days:

- **1,492 Alertmanager alerts** fired / 988 resolved
- **3 Opsgenie alerts** fired / 150 resolved
- Clear visualization of spikes on Jan 1, 9, 14, 20, 28

### Test 2: Pie Chart by Service

Generated a pie chart showing alert distribution by service:
