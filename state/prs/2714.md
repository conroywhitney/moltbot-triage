## Description

Features

- Backward compatible: default driver remains "sqlite"
- SQLite still used for metadata (files, chunks tables) regardless of vector driver
- Embedding cache uses SQLite regardless of vector driver
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector) works with Qdrant
- Fallback to in-process cosine similarity if Qdrant unavailable
- Collection isolation per agent/model combination
