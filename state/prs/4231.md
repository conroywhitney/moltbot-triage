## Description

## Summary
This speeds up `memory_search` vector retrieval when sqlite-vec is enabled by switching from a brute-force `ORDER BY vec_distance_cosine(...)` scan over the full vec0 table to sqlite-vec KNN preselection (`MATCH` + `k`).

## Root cause
The sqlite-vec path was still effectively doing an O(N) scan + global sort:
- compute `vec_distance_cosine(v.embedding, ?)` for every row
- `ORDER BY dist ASC LIMIT ?`

On larger stores this can be tens of seconds per query even on decent CPU/RAM.

## Fix
- Use sqlite-vec KNN (`embedding MATCH ? AND k = ?`) to select a small candidate set.
- Compute cosine distance only for the candidates, then sort/limit.

JS fallback behavior is unchanged when sqlite-vec is unavailable.

## Repro environment (my setup)
Configuration (redacted, but precise):
- `memorySearch.enabled = true`
- `memorySearch.provider = openai`
- `memorySearch.model = text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims)
- `memorySearch.sources = ["memory", "sessions"]` (session memory enabled)
- `memorySearch.extraPaths` indexes an additional large Markdown vault (path omitted)
- Hybrid search enabled (BM25 + vector): `vectorWeight=0.7`, `textWeight=0.3`, `maxResults=15`, `minScore=0.4` (candidate multiplier left at default)
- Embedding cache enabled (`maxEntries=100000`)
- sqlite-vec enabled and loads successfully

Scale:
- Indexed Markdown files: 5,198 total
  - `memory`: 5,057 files / 165,798 chunks
  - `sessions`: 141 files / 934 chunks
- Chunks: 166,732
- SQLite store size: ~8.0 GB

Hardware:
- CPU: AMD EPYC 4244P (6 cores / 12 threads)
- RAM: 30 GiB
- Storage: ~892 GB usable NVMe (RAID1)
- GPU: none for compute (server has only a basic display controller)

Software:
- OS: Linux x86_64
- Node: v22.21.1
- sqlite-vec: 0.1.7-alpha.2

## Performance notes
- Direct SQL benchmark on the above store (top-20): ~75s (brute-force) → ~0.35s (KNN)
- End-to-end CLI (includes embedding API latency): `moltbot memory search --max-results 5 --json "moltbot"` went from >60s to ~3.5s

## Testing
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- Manual spot-check against a real ~166k-chunk store

## AI-assisted disclosure
This PR was AI-assisted (OpenAI Codex CLI).
- Testing level: fully tested (lint + full unit tests + build) + manual runtime check.
- I reviewed/understand the change and am happy to iterate if you’d prefer a different query shape.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR speeds up sqlite-vec-backed `memory_search` by switching from a full-table brute-force `ORDER BY vec_distance_cosine(...)` scan to a two-phase approach: use sqlite-vec KNN (`embedding MATCH ? AND k = ?`) to preselect candidates, then compute cosine distance and sort/limit those results. It also adds a focused unit test to assert the KNN query shape is used when the vector extension is available.


<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Generally safe to merge, but the new KNN query shape may reduce recall when source filters are active.
- The change is localized and test-covered for the SQL shape, but KNN candidate selection currently happens before applying source filters, which can exclude relevant results for the requested sources depending on data distribution.
