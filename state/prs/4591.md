## Description

Remove the `git checkout -- dist/control-ui/` restore step from the update runner — `dist/` is gitignored so the path is never tracked, causing the step to fail and the entire update to report an error. Adds regression test.

Closes #4546

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR removes the `git checkout -- dist/control-ui/` step from the git-based update runner flow. Since `dist/` is gitignored, that restore command could fail and cause the whole update to report an error even when the actual update succeeded.

In `src/infra/update-runner.ts`, the change also updates the expected total step count used for progress reporting to reflect the removed step. In `src/infra/update-runner.test.ts`, it adjusts the existing beta-tag test expectations and adds a regression test asserting the runner no longer attempts to restore `dist/control-ui/` (issue #4546).

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is narrowly scoped: it removes a restore command that is guaranteed to fail for a gitignored path and updates the progress step count accordingly. The accompanying regression test covers the intended behavior change, and no other update logic is altered.
- No files require special attention
