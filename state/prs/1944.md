## Description

**Summary**
The repo ignores ⁠ `dist/` ⁠ via `⁠ .gitignore` ⁠, but a few generated Control UI build outputs under ⁠ `dist/control-ui/ `⁠ were still tracked. This causes the working tree to become dirty after running builds/⁠ `clawdbot update` ⁠, because the build deletes/replaces those tracked files while producing new hashed asset filenames (which are ignored).

**Change**
Remove the tracked ⁠ `dist/control-ui/*` ⁠ artifacts from git so the build can write to ⁠ `dist/ ⁠` without modifying tracked files.

**Result**
Running ⁠ `clawdbot update` ⁠ / control-ui builds no longer leaves the repo in a “dirty” state just due to regenerated UI assets.
