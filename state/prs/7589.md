<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the browser tool and browser client plumbing to support an `authToken` option when calling into the browser control service (including bridge-server auth enforcement), and adjusts the browser tool unit test to accept the new `browserProfiles(baseUrl, { authToken })` call shape.

Change fits the existing architecture by threading authentication through the same `fetchBrowserJson` path used for other browser calls, while allowing sandbox bridge URLs to require a bearer token.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge with low functional risk.
- The changes primarily thread an auth token through existing browser client APIs and update tests accordingly; the main concern is that the updated test assertion is permissive and may not catch unintended option forwarding.

The `profiles` assertion is permissive: it will still pass if other unexpected options are forwarded. Consider asserting exact args so the test catches accidental extra params.
