<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Replaces multiple ASCII diagrams in the docs with Mermaid `flowchart`/`sequenceDiagram` blocks to improve readability and responsiveness across renderers.

Most changes are localized to documentation pages (`docs/index.md`, gateway/security pages, and localized `docs/zh-CN/index.md`) and don’t affect runtime code. Main risk is docs rendering compatibility: wrapping Mermaid code fences in HTML `<p>` blocks can prevent the Mermaid fences from being parsed in some Markdown engines, causing diagrams to render as plain code/text.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; the main concern is documentation rendering consistency across Markdown/Mintlify/Markdown-it configurations.
- Changes are documentation-only and mechanically replace ASCII diagrams with Mermaid. Potential issues are limited to how Mermaid fences are parsed when wrapped in HTML and a few Mermaid label/style quirks.
- Pay closest attention to docs pages where Mermaid fences are wrapped in `<p align="center">` blocks (multiple files), since rendering can differ by Markdown engine.
