## Description

## Summary

Adds a recommendation for the [prompt-guard](https://github.com/seojoonkim/prompt-guard) security skill in the Security defaults section of the README.

## Why?

Moltbot users running agents in group chats or multi-user environments are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. Prompt Guard provides:

- 🌍 Multi-language detection (EN/KO/JA/ZH)
- 🔐 Secret exfiltration blocking
- 👤 Owner-only command restrictions
- 🔧 Security audit tools

## Changes

- Added "Recommended: Prompt Injection Defense" subsection under Security defaults
- Links to GitHub repo and ClawdHub installation

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `README.md`’s “Security defaults (DM access)” section by adding a new “Recommended: Prompt Injection Defense” subsection that suggests installing the third-party Prompt Guard skill via `clawdhub install prompt-guard`, and links to the skill’s GitHub repo and ClawdHub listing. The change fits as an additional hardening recommendation for users operating Moltbot in group chats/multi-user environments, complementing the existing DM pairing/allowlist guidance.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s a small documentation-only change with minor messaging/trust clarity considerations.
- The change only adds README text and links, so there’s no runtime impact. The main risk is readers interpreting the recommendation as official/vetted; adding a short third-party disclaimer would reduce confusion.

Better way might be using ACIP instead:
https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/acip

It's very comprehensive with a one liner install:

```
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/acip/main/integrations/clawdbot/install.sh" | bash
```
