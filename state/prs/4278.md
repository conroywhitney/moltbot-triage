## Description

## Summary

Adds a recommendation for the [prompt-guard](https://github.com/seojoonkim/prompt-guard) security skill in the Security defaults section of the README.

## Why?

Moltbot users running agents in group chats or multi-user environments are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. Prompt Guard provides:

- 🌍 Multi-language detection (EN/KO/JA/ZH)
- 🔐 Secret exfiltration blocking
- 👤 Owner-only command restrictions
- 🔧 Security audit tools

## Changes

- Added "Recommended: Prompt Injection Defense" subsection under Security defaults
- Links to GitHub repo and ClawdHub installation

Better way might be using ACIP instead:
https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/acip

It's very comprehensive with a one liner install:

```
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/acip/main/integrations/clawdbot/install.sh" | bash
```
