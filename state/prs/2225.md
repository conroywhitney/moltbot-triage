## Description

This PR contains a set of fixes/improvements discovered while pairing an Android node over Tailscale and validating Canvas/A2UI.

Highlights:
- Force-register BouncyCastle provider on Android to ensure Ed25519 identity works on OEM builds.
- Expose Identity status + Reset identity button in Settings.
- Fix operator handshake client id/mode (avoid CONTROL_UI secure-context rules).
- Add Request Pairing UI and send node.pair.request (with correct nodeId once identity is enabled).
- Improve Settings UX around connected/operator-offline states.
- Add A2UI WebView bridge compat shim (force string payloads) + direct action->node.invoke wiring for a small demo control panel.

Notes:
- There is a known remaining issue: on some devices the Compose overlays may block WebView touch events; not addressed in this PR yet.
