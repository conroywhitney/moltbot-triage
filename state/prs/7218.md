## Description

In Telegram threaded mode, natural chat replies were being sent with empty message bodies, causing 400 errors from the Telegram API ("message text is empty").

Root cause: When a reply payload has only whitespace or tag-stripped content, the text becomes empty but still reaches the Telegram API because:
1. The chunk loop didn't check for empty HTML content
2. sendTelegramText() had no validation unlike sendMessageTelegram()

This fix adds:
- Empty chunk validation in the delivery loop (skip chunks with empty HTML)
- Early return in sendTelegramText() for empty/whitespace text

Fixes #7186

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR tightens Telegram reply delivery in threaded mode by skipping empty chunks in the text-only send loop and adding an early return in `sendTelegramText()` when the input is empty/whitespace, preventing Telegram API 400s for “message text is empty”. The change lives entirely in `src/telegram/bot/delivery.ts`, affecting how markdown is chunked/converted to HTML and ultimately passed into `bot.api.sendMessage`.

Main thing to double-check is that the emptiness checks match what’s actually sent: `sendTelegramText()` may transform `text` into `htmlText` (or fall back to `plainText`), so validating only the pre-transform `text.trim()`/`chunk.html.trim()` can still allow an empty final payload (or skip a payload that would send via fallback).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and fixes the reported Telegram 400s, with a small chance of remaining edge cases around HTML/markdown transformations.
- Change scope is small and targeted (skipping empty chunks and early-returning on empty text). The main remaining risk is mismatch between what’s checked for emptiness (`text`/`chunk.html`) vs what’s actually sent (`htmlText` or fallback `plainText`), which could leave rare cases where Telegram still receives an empty message.
- src/telegram/bot/delivery.ts (validate emptiness on the final outgoing message string in both normal and fallback send paths)

**`src/telegram/bot/delivery.ts`**
[P1] `sendTelegramText()` now skips empty/whitespace `text`, but when `opts.textMode === "html"` the *actual* payload sent is `htmlText` (`text` is treated as already-HTML). It’s possible for `text` to be non-empty while `htmlText` ends up empty/whitespace after formatting/tag stripping (the original root-cause described), which would still trigger Telegram’s 400.

Consider validating the final outgoing string instead (e.g., check `htmlText.trim()` right before `sendMessage`), or check both `text` and `htmlText` when `textMode === "html"`.

This also affects the HTML-parse fallback path because it uses `fallbackText = opts?.plainText ?? text`; `plainText` can be whitespace-only while `text` is non-empty HTML, so validating the exact outgoing string avoids edge cases.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
