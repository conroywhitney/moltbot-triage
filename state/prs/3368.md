## Description

## Summary
<img width="3656" height="2560" alt="CleanShot 2026-01-28 at 16 27 14@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b97801c3-9536-4b06-8c67-38a31ef88ea8" />

Fixes #3367

Three related fixes for Telegram DM topics:

1. **Display**: Adds `ThreadLabel` so DM topic sessions show their thread ID
2. **Navigation**: Fixes clicking a session in Sessions tab redirecting to Main instead of the selected session
3. **Delivery**: Fixes bot replies going to General instead of the originating DM thread (regression from commit 9154971)

## Changes

- **src/telegram/bot-message-context.ts**: Set `ThreadLabel: "Thread: N"` for non-group messages with `messageThreadId`; introduce `effectiveThreadId` for correct outbound delivery in DM threads
- **src/telegram/bot-message-context.dm-threads.test.ts**: Add tests for ThreadLabel in DM threads
- **ui/src/ui/app-lifecycle.ts**: Read URL session param before `syncTabWithLocation` overwrites it with localStorage value

## Problem 1: Display

All DM topic sessions showed the same display name. Now each shows its thread ID (`Thread: 42`, `Thread: 99`).

## Problem 2: Navigation

Clicking a session in the Sessions tab redirected to Main instead of the clicked session.

**Root cause**: `syncTabWithLocation()` was called before `applySettingsFromUrl()`, overwriting the URL `?session=` param with localStorage.

**Fix**: Call `applySettingsFromUrl()` first.

## Problem 3: DM Thread Delivery (regression)

Commit 9154971 (`fix(telegram): ignore message_thread_id for non-forum group sessions`) changed `resolveTelegramForumThreadId` to return `undefined` when `is_forum` is false. This correctly fixed reply-chain pollution in regular groups, but broke DM thread delivery:

- Telegram Bot API **never** sets `is_forum=true` for private chats (only supergroups)
- `context.resolvedThreadId` (used by `bot-message-dispatch.ts` for draft streaming and reply delivery) became `undefined` for all DM threads
- Replies, typing indicators, and voice recording indicators all went to General

**Fix**: Introduce `effectiveThreadId = isGroup ? resolvedThreadId : messageThreadId` — uses raw `messageThreadId` for DMs (bypassing the forum gate) while preserving forum-resolved value for groups.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test src/telegram/bot-message-context.dm-threads.test.ts
```

All 7 tests pass, including 2 new tests for ThreadLabel.
