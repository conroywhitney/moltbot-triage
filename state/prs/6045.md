## Description

---

  Description

  Problem:
  OpenClaw fails to detect Gemini CLI on Windows because it cannot correctly resolve the global npm package path
  structure. The relative path between the binary file and node_modules on Windows differs from Linux/macOS, which
  prevents the system from reading oauth2.js to retrieve the OAuth configuration.

  Changes:
  I have modified extensions/google-gemini-cli-auth/oauth.ts to include specific search path logic for Windows
  environments. This allows OpenClaw to correctly locate the Gemini CLI credentials file within the global npm
  directory.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `extensions/google-gemini-cli-auth/oauth.ts` to better locate the Gemini CLI’s bundled `oauth2.js` on Windows by adding additional Windows-only candidate paths derived from the resolved `gemini` executable path. The intent is to handle global npm install directory layouts that differ from macOS/Linux so OpenClaw can extract the OAuth client config automatically.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but Windows path resolution assumptions may still miss common global npm layouts.
- Change is localized and gated on `process.platform === "win32"`, but the new logic assumes `dirname(resolvedPath)` is a global npm prefix; when `gemini` resolves to a .cmd/.bat shim in `%APPDATA%\npm`, the actual `node_modules` root may be elsewhere, so the fix might not work for all users.
