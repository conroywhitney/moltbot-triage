## Description

## Summary
This PR adds a comprehensive guide for running Nebius models (e.g., GLM-4.7, Qwen3) with OpenClaw using LiteLLM as an OpenAI-compatible proxy.

## What's included
- ✅ LiteLLM systemd setup with config templates
- ✅ OpenClaw provider configuration
- ✅ Troubleshooting section for common issues
- ✅ TL;DR quick reference for emergency use

## Why this matters
- Enables open-source model support without relying on proprietary APIs
- No rate limits — use your own Nebius API key
- Cost-effective alternative for local/self-hosted deployments
- Pattern applies to any OpenAI-compatible model provider

## File added
- `docs/providers/litellm-nebius.md` — complete setup guide

Let me know if anything needs adjustment!

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new provider doc at `docs/providers/litellm-nebius.md` describing how to run Nebius-hosted models behind LiteLLM and point OpenClaw at the local OpenAI-compatible proxy. The guide includes a LiteLLM config template, OpenClaw provider config snippet, service restart steps, and troubleshooting/curl validation workflow.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; changes are docs-only with a few consistency/usability nits.
- Only a new documentation file is added. The main risks are broken Mintlify anchors from the em dash title and instructions that may not work for some readers (root-specific paths, assuming python3).
- docs/providers/litellm-nebius.md
