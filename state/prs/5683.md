## Description

## Changes

### 1. fix(cron): default enabled=true for new jobs
New cron jobs should default to enabled unless explicitly set to false.

### 2. feat(gateway): add retry logic with exponential backoff for timeout errors
- Increase default timeout from 10s to 30s for busy gateways
- Add up to 2 retry attempts on timeout errors only
- Implement exponential backoff (500ms, 1s) between retries
- Non-timeout errors still fail immediately

This helps with transient gateway timeouts during high load.
