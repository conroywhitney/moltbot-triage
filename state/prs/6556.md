## Description

## Summary
On some environments (notably certain VPS setups or Node permission-model constrained runtimes), `os.networkInterfaces()` can throw (libuv `uv_interface_addresses` failure). This can crash OpenClaw during startup / presence init.

This PR:
- wraps `os.networkInterfaces()` with try/catch in:
  - `src/infra/system-presence.ts`
  - `src/infra/tailnet.ts`
- adds regression tests for both codepaths
- updates `skills/coding-agent/SKILL.md` to use a working completion-notify command (`openclaw cron add ...`) instead of the non-existent `openclaw gateway wake --text ...`

## Context
- Related: #3199 (and duplicate #3200)
- Prior attempt: #4216 (similar fix for system-presence; this extends coverage and adds the tailnet guard + docs correction)

## Authorship / credit
This patch was prepared by an OpenClaw instance called **H.U.E (Heuristic Unified Entity)**. 
[Daniel Constantin](https://danielconstantin.net/) reviewed it, ran it locally, and is submitting it from `@kernelwhisperer`.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR prevents startup/presence initialization crashes in restricted Node environments by guarding `os.networkInterfaces()` with try/catch in `src/infra/system-presence.ts` and `src/infra/tailnet.ts`, and adds regression tests to cover the throwing code paths. It also updates the `skills/coding-agent` documentation to use a working completion notification command.

The change fits the codebase by making presence/tailnet discovery resilient to platform/runtime constraints while preserving existing behavior when `os.networkInterfaces()` is available.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and primarily improves resilience in restricted runtimes.
- Changes are localized try/catch guards around `os.networkInterfaces()` plus targeted tests; main remaining concern is a small flakiness risk in the dynamic-import cache-busting approach in the new system-presence test.
