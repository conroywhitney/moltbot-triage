## Description

Anthropic's Consumer Terms of Service (Section 3) restricts automated access except via API Key. This adds a warning to help users understand the risks of using setup-tokens with third-party tools.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docs/providers/anthropic.md` by adding a prominent “Terms of Service Notice” block under **Option B: Claude setup-token**, explaining that Anthropic’s Consumer ToS may restrict automated/non-human access except via an API key, and recommending **Option A (API Key)** for production/risk-averse usage.

This fits the docs’ existing structure by clarifying the trade-offs between the two authentication options without changing any product behavior; it adds user-facing guidance where setup-token onboarding is documented.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Documentation-only change that adds a warning block and does not affect runtime behavior; wording appears consistent with surrounding docs and introduces no build/test impact.
- No files require special attention
