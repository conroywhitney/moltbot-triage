## Description

## What

Clarifies the distinction between `groupAllowFrom` (sender allowlist) and `groups` (group allowlist) in the groups documentation.

## Why

We spent a debugging session chasing a "bug" where WhatsApp group messages silently stopped working after a restart. Turned out we'd put a group JID in `groupAllowFrom` — which expects phone numbers/user IDs. The field name is ambiguous enough that `groupAllowFrom` reads naturally as "allow from these groups".

Filed as [#1952](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/issues/1952) before we identified the real cause.

## Changes

- **TL;DR section**: Split vague "group access" bullet into three clear ones (which groups, which senders, policy mode). Added ⚠️ callout.
- **Quick-reference table**: Added "(phone numbers, not group IDs)" clarification and new "anyone can trigger" row. Added "Common mistake" callout box.
- **Evaluation order**: Expanded from 3 vague steps to 4 explicit steps with descriptions.
- **Group policy notes**: Clarified `groupAllowFrom` is a sender filter with ⚠️ warning.

## AI-assisted 🤖

Written with Claude (via Clawdbot). The misconfiguration was experienced first-hand and the docs changes were verified against the actual access-control code in `src/web/inbound/access-control.ts`.

Lightly tested (docs-only change, no code changes).
