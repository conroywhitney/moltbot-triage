<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the human-readable `/status` and `/status --all` outputs to add a dedicated **Model** row (and removes the redundant default model info from the Sessions overview line). It also adds a couple of assertions in `status.test.ts` to confirm the model appears in the formatted output.

Most of the change is localized to how the Overview rows are assembled in `src/commands/status.command.ts` and `src/commands/status-all.ts`, plus a small test update. The behavior for `--json` output is unchanged.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; changes are mostly presentation-level with minor consistency/test robustness concerns.
- Review found no obvious runtime hazards in the new `/status` row construction, and tests were updated. Main concern is that `/status --all` now derives the model from config and omits context-token info, so the new Model row can disagree with `/status` and the PR description goal. A smaller concern is the looseness of the new test assertion which could pass for unrelated output changes.
- src/commands/status-all.ts; src/commands/status.test.ts
