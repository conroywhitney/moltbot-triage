## Description

Confused me when trying to understand the architecture.

Keep up the good work, little agents! 🤖

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the documentation in `docs/concepts/agent.md` to replace outdated references to **p-mono** with **pi-mono**, and adds links to the upstream `pi-mono` to reduce confusion about what Moltbot reuses vs. what it owns (session management, discovery, tool wiring).

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it only adjusts documentation text and links.
- Changes are limited to a single markdown doc and are straightforward reference corrections with no code-path impact.
- No files require special attention
