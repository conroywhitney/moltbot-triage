## Description

## Summary
- Previously, heartbeat was only allowed to run with an empty `HEARTBEAT.md` if `reason === "exec-event"`. Any other system event source (cron reminders, node events) would be silently dropped.
- Now checks `hasSystemEvents(sessionKey)` directly against the event queue, so heartbeat runs whenever pending system events exist regardless of trigger source.
- Refactors `resolveHeartbeatSession` into `resolveHeartbeatSessionKey` (pure key resolution, no I/O) + `resolveHeartbeatSession` (loads store) so the skip check can resolve the key cheaply.

## Test plan
- [x] New test: empty `HEARTBEAT.md` + queued system event → heartbeat still runs
- [x] All 4 heartbeat test suites pass
- [x] `system-events.test.ts` passes

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes heartbeat skipping when `HEARTBEAT.md` is effectively empty but system events are queued. It introduces a cheap session-key resolution helper (`resolveHeartbeatSessionKey`) so the runner can check `hasSystemEvents(sessionKey)` before doing heavier session-store I/O, and adds a regression test ensuring queued system events still trigger a heartbeat run.

The change fits into the existing heartbeat runner flow by refining the early “empty HEARTBEAT.md” skip gate (in `runHeartbeatOnce`) to be based on actual pending system events instead of the trigger `reason` string, which better matches how system events are produced (cron, node events, exec completion, etc.).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and should fix the intended heartbeat skip bug.
- The behavioral change is small and localized to the heartbeat skip gate, and it’s backed by a targeted regression test. The main risk is that the new pre-check calls `hasSystemEvents()` earlier in the flow, which can throw if a session key is invalid/empty, potentially turning a benign skip check into a hard failure in misconfigured environments.
