## Description

## Summary
- Previously, heartbeat was only allowed to run with an empty `HEARTBEAT.md` if `reason === "exec-event"`. Any other system event source (cron reminders, node events) would be silently dropped.
- Now checks `hasSystemEvents(sessionKey)` directly against the event queue, so heartbeat runs whenever pending system events exist regardless of trigger source.
- Refactors `resolveHeartbeatSession` into `resolveHeartbeatSessionKey` (pure key resolution, no I/O) + `resolveHeartbeatSession` (loads store) so the skip check can resolve the key cheaply.

## Test plan
- [x] New test: empty `HEARTBEAT.md` + queued system event → heartbeat still runs
- [x] All 4 heartbeat test suites pass
- [x] `system-events.test.ts` passes
