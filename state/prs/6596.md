## Description

## Fix pre-existing formatting issues causing CI failures

Ran `pnpm format:fix` to address formatting violations that were causing CI failures on other PRs.

### Files Fixed
- docker-compose.yml
- docs/channels/telegram.md  
- docs/concepts/model-providers.md
- docs/docs.json
- docs/providers/moonshot.md
- docs/start/onboarding.md
- docs/web/control-ui.md
- skills/canvas/SKILL.md

### Context
These appear to be pre-existing formatting issues that were caught when CI runs `oxfmt --check`. Not my submission to correct, but this should make CI complain less if merged.

Only whitespace/formatting changes - no functional modifications.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR applies automated formatting fixes across YAML/JSON/docs to satisfy `oxfmt --check` in CI.

Most changes are whitespace-only, but the Moonshot docs formatting altered the sync markers used by `scripts/sync-moonshot-docs.ts`, which is part of the repo’s docs maintenance workflow; those markers should remain as the exact strings the script searches for.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is due to a docs-sync marker regression.
- While the intent is formatting-only, the Moonshot docs markers were changed in a way that will break `scripts/sync-moonshot-docs.ts` (string match for HTML comment markers), causing the sync script to error and potentially blocking future updates.
- docs/providers/moonshot.md, docs/concepts/model-providers.md, scripts/sync-moonshot-docs.ts

seems like the tools may be fighting a little bit.   close this if you like.

The formatting fixes look good, but there's an issue with the Moonshot docs sync markers. The formatter changed them from HTML comments to JSX-style comments, which will break the sync script.

The sync script (`scripts/sync-moonshot-docs.ts`) expects these exact HTML comment markers:
- `<!-- moonshot-kimi-k2-ids:start -->` and `<!-- moonshot-kimi-k2-ids:end -->` in `docs/providers/moonshot.md`
- `<!-- moonshot-kimi-k2-model-refs:start -->` and `<!-- moonshot-kimi-k2-model-refs:end -->` in `docs/concepts/model-providers.md`

The PR changed them to `{/_ ... _/}` format, which will cause the sync script to fail.

**Fix needed:** Revert the marker changes in:
- `docs/providers/moonshot.md` (lines 18, 25)
- `docs/concepts/model-providers.md` (lines 137, 143)

Keep them as HTML comments: `<!-- ... -->`

All other formatting fixes are good to go!
