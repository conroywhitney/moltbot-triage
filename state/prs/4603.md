## Description

Summary
Fixes https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/4111

This PR addresses issues with Antigravity API requests by updating the `User-Agent` header to a more recent and specific value (`antigravity/1.15.8 linux/arm64`). Currently proving as a band-aid to fix it.

**Antigravity API compatibility improvements:**

* Updated the `User-Agent` header in `extensions/google-antigravity-auth/index.ts` to `antigravity/1.15.8 linux/arm64` when fetching the project ID, replacing the older `google-api-nodejs-client/9.15.1` string.
* Changed the `User-Agent` header in `src/infra/provider-usage.fetch.antigravity.ts` to `antigravity/1.15.8 linux/arm64` for Antigravity usage requests, ensuring consistent identification across requests.

**Documentation:**

* Added a changelog entry describing the User-Agent update for Antigravity to version 1.15.8, highlighting the fix for "no longer supported" errors.
