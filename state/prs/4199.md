## Description

## Summary
- Auto-approve device pairing requests when the connection is authenticated via Tailscale (`authMethod === "tailscale"`)
- Previously, only localhost/loopback connections (`isLocalClient`) were auto-approved, which meant Tailscale Serve connections to a headless gateway required manual pairing approval that could never be granted (no UI to click "Approve")

## Test plan
- [x] Tested connecting macOS companion app via WSS to a headless Linux gateway running behind Tailscale Serve
- [x] Verified device pairing is auto-approved (gateway logs: `device pairing auto-approved`)
- [x] Confirmed the app connects successfully after the fix

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes the gateway websocket handshake/pairing flow so that device pairing requests are marked `silent` (and therefore auto-approved) not only for loopback/local connections, but also when the connection is authenticated via Tailscale (`authMethod === "tailscale"`). This aligns the pairing UX with headless gateways behind Tailscale Serve by removing the need for an interactive approval step.

The change is localized to `attachGatewayWsMessageHandler` in `src/gateway/server/ws-connection/message-handler.ts`, where the `requestDevicePairing` call sets `silent` based on the connection’s auth method.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; it’s a small, localized behavior change with some security-sensitive implications.
- The diff is a single-line change in the pairing path, so regression surface is small. However, auto-approving pairing based on `authMethod === "tailscale"` widens the set of connections that can silently pair, and it’s worth double-checking that `authorizeGatewayConnect` cannot misclassify auth method for non-Tailscale requests.

**`src/gateway/server/ws-connection/message-handler.ts`**
[P1] Auto-approving pairing for any `authMethod === "tailscale"` may be broader than intended if `authorizeGatewayConnect()` can return `method: "tailscale"` in cases where Tailscale headers are spoofed or the connection isn’t actually coming from Tailscale Serve. Since this bypasses the manual approval step, it would be safer to additionally gate on a stronger signal (e.g., a verified tailscale identity / `resolvedAuth.allowTailscale === true` and/or a request property indicating the tailscale check succeeded) rather than the string value alone.

This comment is about ensuring the silent auto-approval only triggers when the request is *definitively* Tailscale-authenticated, not merely labeled that way.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
