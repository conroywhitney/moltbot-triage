## Description

This PR addresses İki critical issues encountered when running OpenClaw on Windows environments, specifically ensuring that binary files for various skills are correctly detected and executed:

1. **Binary Detection**: Enhances the `hasBinary` check to account for Windows-specific file extensions (`.exe`, `.cmd`, `.bat`). This change ensures that binary files belonging to various skills are correctly detected, which was previously failing due to missing platform-specific extensions.
2. **Command Execution**: Enables `shell: true` in the exec process for Windows to correctly handle scripts (like `.cmd` files) that cannot be spawned directly without a shell context.


### Technical Details

#### 1. Binary Detection (Extension Support)
Files: [src/agents/skills/config.ts](src/agents/skills/config.ts) and [src/hooks/config.ts](src/hooks/config.ts)
Modifies `hasBinary` to iterate through common Windows extensions when running on `win32`.

#### 2. Shell Support (Execution Context)
File: [src/process/exec.ts](src/process/exec.ts)
Adds `shell: process.platform === 'win32'` to the `spawn` options in `runCommandWithTimeout`.

### Why is this necessary?
Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`), Go, or custom `.bat` scripts were not being detected or executed correctly on Windows. This patch removes these functionality barriers by ensuring skill binaries are found and executable via the shell.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR improves Windows compatibility in two places: (1) `hasBinary` now checks common Windows executable extensions when scanning `PATH`, so skills/hooks gated on external binaries (e.g. `gcloud`) are detected correctly; and (2) `runCommandWithTimeout` now spawns commands with `shell: true` on win32, which allows `.cmd`/`.bat` scripts to run.

The changes fit into the existing gating/execution flow by affecting how skills/hooks decide they’re eligible (via `hasBinary`) and how the process layer invokes external tools (via `runCommandWithTimeout`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Reasonably safe to merge, but the unconditional `shell: true` on Windows can change behavior for existing command executions.
- Binary-extension probing is a contained change and likely fixes real Windows misses; however, enabling `shell` for every spawned command on win32 can alter argument quoting and ignores `windowsVerbatimArguments`, which may break some call sites.
- src/process/exec.ts (interaction between `shell` and argument quoting / windowsVerbatimArguments)

## Pull request overview

This PR enhances Windows compatibility for OpenClaw by addressing binary detection and command execution issues that prevented proper operation with Windows-specific executables like gcloud.cmd and .bat scripts.

**Changes:**
- Added Windows-specific file extension handling in binary detection
- Enabled shell execution context for Windows command spawning
- Applied changes to both hooks and skills configuration modules

**`src/process/exec.ts`**
[P1] `shell: true` on Windows changes how `spawn` interprets `argv[0]`/args and can break callers that rely on direct exec (quoting/escaping, exit codes, and built-ins). In particular, `windowsVerbatimArguments` is ignored when `shell` is enabled, so any call sites setting it (e.g. URL quoting) won’t behave as intended.

If the goal is to support `.cmd`/`.bat`, consider only enabling `shell` when `argv[0]` is a script/built-in (or when `spawn` would otherwise fail), rather than for all commands on win32.

Also appears in: src/daemon/launchd.ts:109 (same `shell: process.platform === "win32"`).
