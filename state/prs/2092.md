## Description

## Problem
  Nextcloud Talk bot API returns 401 authentication errors because the signature is calculated over the full JSON body instead of just the message text.

  ## Root Cause
  Nextcloud's `ChecksumVerificationService.php` verifies:
  ```php
  hash_hmac('sha256', $random . $data, $secret)
  Where $data is the extracted message text, not the raw JSON body.

  Fix

  - sendMessageNextcloudTalk: Sign only the message text
  - sendReactionNextcloudTalk: Sign only the reaction string

  Testing

  - Fully tested on self-hosted Nextcloud 30 with Talk bot
  - Messages send successfully (was getting 401 before)

  AI Disclosure

  - AI-assisted (Claude Code)
  - I understand what the code does
  - Root cause found by reading Nextcloud source code (ChecksumVerificationService.php)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates Nextcloud Talk bot request signing to match Nextcloud’s server-side checksum verification: instead of signing the full JSON request body, `sendMessageNextcloudTalk` now signs the extracted message text and `sendReactionNextcloudTalk` signs the reaction string. Requests still send the same JSON bodies, but the `X-Nextcloud-Talk-Bot-*` headers are computed over the specific fields Nextcloud validates, resolving prior 401 authentication failures against Talk bot endpoints.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and fixes a concrete interoperability/auth issue with Nextcloud Talk bot signing.
- Change is small and localized to signature input values for two outbound requests; it aligns with documented Nextcloud behavior and does not alter request payloads. No obvious runtime/type issues introduced. Main remaining uncertainty is upstream compatibility across Nextcloud Talk versions/endpoints (message vs reaction field extraction), which is mitigated by the author’s manual test on Nextcloud 30.
