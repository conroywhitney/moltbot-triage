## Description

  ## Problem
  Nextcloud Talk bot API returns 401 authentication errors because the signature is calculated over the full JSON body instead of just the message text.

  ## Root Cause
  Nextcloud's `ChecksumVerificationService.php` verifies:
  ```php
  hash_hmac('sha256', $random . $data, $secret)
  Where $data is the extracted message text, not the raw JSON body.

  Fix

  - sendMessageNextcloudTalk: Sign only the message text
  - sendReactionNextcloudTalk: Sign only the reaction string

  Testing

  - Fully tested on self-hosted Nextcloud 30 with Talk bot
  - Messages send successfully (was getting 401 before)

  AI Disclosure

  - AI-assisted (Claude Code)
  - I understand what the code does
  - Root cause found by reading Nextcloud source code (ChecksumVerificationService.php)
