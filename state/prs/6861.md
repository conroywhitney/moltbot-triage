## Description

Removes 5 invisible Unicode citation markers (e.g. `citeturn2search0`) that were accidentally left in the TTS documentation from AI-generated content.

These invisible characters don't affect rendering but pollute the source file.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR cleans up `docs/tts.md` by removing five invisible Unicode “AI citation marker” tokens (e.g., `citeturn2search0`) that were accidentally left in the documentation.

The change is purely documentation-source hygiene: it doesn’t alter any product behavior, but it prevents hidden characters from polluting diffs, search, and future edits.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it only removes stray invisible characters from a documentation file.
- The diff is limited to deleting five hidden Unicode marker sequences in `docs/tts.md` with no structural markdown changes and no code/runtime impact.
- No files require special attention
