## Description

Long commands pushed approval buttons off-screen, blocking user workflow. Add max-height and overflow-y to .exec-approval-command so buttons stay visible and users can scroll to see full command.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts the exec approval modal styling by capping the visible height of `.exec-approval-command` and enabling vertical scrolling. The goal is to prevent long commands from pushing the approval action buttons off-screen, keeping the approval/reject controls accessible while still allowing users to view the full command by scrolling.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small, localized CSS adjustment (max-height + overflow-y) on a single selector, with no apparent impact on unrelated UI components and no logic/runtime implications.
- No files require special attention
