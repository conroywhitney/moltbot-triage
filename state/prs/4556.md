## Description

## what

when a long message gets split into chunks (via `chunkMode` or length splitting), they all fire at once. instant. robotic. nobody texts like that.

this adds `chunkDelay`. a config option that introduces typing delays between chunk sends. typing indicators show during the pause so the recipient sees "typing..." between messages.

## config

```json5
// enable with defaults (50ms/char, 800ms base, 6s cap, 25% jitter)
channels: { signal: { chunkDelay: {} } }

// custom tuning
channels: { signal: { chunkDelay: { perCharMs: 40, baseMs: 600 } } }

// disabled (default. just omit the key)
channels: { signal: {} }
```

presence of `chunkDelay` enables it. omit the key to disable. all fields optional with sensible defaults.

### options

| option | type | default | description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `perCharMs` | `number` | `50` | ms per character (~30 WPM) |
| `baseMs` | `number` | `800` | minimum delay between chunks |
| `maxMs` | `number` | `6000` | maximum delay cap |
| `jitter` | `0-1` | `0.25` | random variance (±25%) |

## how it works

1. agent generates full reply as usual. no change to thinking speed
2. reply gets chunked as normal (length or newline mode)
3. first chunk sends immediately
4. before each subsequent chunk: typing indicator, sleep, send
5. delay formula: `min(baseMs + chunkLength * perCharMs, maxMs) +/- jitter`

a short "yeah" gets ~800ms. a full sentence gets a few seconds. long messages cap at 6s. jitter keeps it from feeling mechanical.

## files changed (7 files, +76/-3)

- `src/config/types.base.ts`. ChunkDelayConfig type
- `src/config/zod-schema.core.ts`. ChunkDelaySchema validation
- `src/config/types.signal.ts`. added to SignalAccountConfig
- `src/config/zod-schema.providers-core.ts`. added to signal schema
- `src/signal/monitor.ts`. core delay logic + delivery changes
- `src/signal/monitor/event-handler.ts`. wire-through
- `src/signal/monitor/event-handler.types.ts`. type updates

signal-only for now. ChunkDelayConfig is generic though. easy to extend to other providers later.
