## Description

The skill creation process has issues executing the script as it tries to execute directly relying on the shebang and it just starts creating the skill "by hand"

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes the file mode of the skill-creator helper scripts (`init_skill.py`, `package_skill.py`, `quick_validate.py`) from non-executable to executable, so they can be run directly via their `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang (instead of requiring `python …`). This aligns with the skill creation flow described in the PR: the tooling expects to invoke these scripts directly and was failing when the executable bit wasn’t set.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is limited to file permission bits (100644→100755) on three existing Python scripts; no code paths or runtime logic were modified, so the behavioral risk is low and it directly addresses the reported execution issue when relying on shebang invocation.
- No files require special attention
