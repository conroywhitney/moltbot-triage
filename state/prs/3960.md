<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR makes the post-`ui:build` cleanup more robust by conditionally restoring `dist/control-ui/` only when it’s tracked by git, avoiding failures on newer checkouts where that path is no longer in the index.

The change sits in `runGatewayUpdate`’s git-update flow, right after `ui:build`, and is meant to prevent the repo from being left dirty (which can block future updates).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the directory-tracked check may not work reliably as written.
- Change is small and localized, but uses `git ls-files --error-unmatch dist/control-ui/` to detect tracking; if that pathspec doesn’t match directory contents, restore may be skipped when needed, reintroducing the dirty-repo problem the step is meant to prevent.
