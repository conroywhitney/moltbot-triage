## Description

## Summary

Adds support for per-channel and per-guild model overrides in Discord configuration.

## Changes

### Config Schema
- Added `model?: string` to `DiscordGuildChannelConfig` and `DiscordGuildEntry` types
- Added corresponding Zod schema validation

### Model Resolution
Channel model overrides follow the priority: session override → channel config → guild config → agent default

### New Command
Added `/model-channel <model>` command to set model overrides for the current Discord channel via native commands.

## Example Config

```yaml
channels:
  discord:
    guilds:
      my-server:
        model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4  # Guild-level default
        channels:
          general:
            model: anthropic/claude-haiku  # Channel-specific override
          support:
            model: openai/gpt-4o
```

## Testing
- Build passes (`pnpm build`)
- Existing tests pass

Closes #3742
