## Description

Change associative array to indexed array for macos compatibility -- (using docker)

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docker-setup.sh` to replace an associative array with an indexed array for macOS compatibility.

However, the script still uses `seen` with string keys (`seen["$k"]=1` and `${seen[$k]}`), which only works correctly with `declare -A`. With `declare -a`, those subscripts are treated as arithmetic and can collide (often at index 0), breaking the `upsert_env` dedupe/replace logic when multiple keys are processed.

In context, `upsert_env` is responsible for updating `.env` entries used by the Docker compose setup; if it mis-tracks which keys were written, the generated `.env` can have missing or duplicated variables, causing confusing Docker behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is because it breaks `upsert_env` key tracking.
- The only change swaps `declare -A` to `declare -a` but the code continues to rely on associative-array semantics; in bash this will cause key collisions and incorrect `.env` output for most inputs, which is a functional regression.
- docker-setup.sh (upsert_env / seen array logic)
