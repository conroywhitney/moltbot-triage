## Description

## Summary
Fixes #3226 - `session_status` tool now accepts calls with no arguments as documented.

## Problem
When LLM calls `session_status` without arguments, validation fails with "root: must be object" error, causing session to become unresponsive.

## Solution
- Allow `undefined` args by defaulting to empty object
- Default to current session when no sessionKey provided
- Update schema to explicitly handle empty objects
- Add test case for undefined args scenario

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ New test added for undefined args case
- ✅ Lint and build successful

## AI-Assisted
This PR was created with AI assistance (Kiro CLI) and has been fully tested.
