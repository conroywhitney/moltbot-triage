## Description

## Summary

- **Fixes Signal only processing first attachment** - Previously `attachments[0]` was taken, silently dropping additional attachments
- **Parallel fetching** - Uses `Promise.all()` for ~4x speedup when processing multiple images
- **UX improvement** - Sends "Processing N images..." message for multi-attachment messages
- **Backwards compatible** - Populates both `MediaPath` (singular) and `MediaPaths` (array)

## Test plan

- [x] Tested with 4-image Signal message - all 4 images detected and processed
- [x] Verified parallel fetch reduces processing time
- [x] Confirmed "Processing images" message appears for multi-attachment messages
- [x] Single attachment messages still work as before

## Related

Follows the same pattern as the Line channel which already supports multiple attachments.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Signal inbound event handler to support multiple attachments per message by fetching all attachments (with an `id`) in parallel via `Promise.all`, and by emitting array fields (`MediaPaths`, `MediaTypes`, `MediaUrls`) alongside the existing singular media fields for backward compatibility. It also adds a user-facing "Processing N images..." status message when multiple attachments are present, and updates debouncing/placeholder generation to account for multi-attachment messages.

Overall the change matches existing multi-media patterns in the codebase (e.g., Line/iMessage) and improves correctness by no longer silently dropping attachments beyond index 0.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with minor edge-case handling to consider around group targets and attachment counts.
- The changes are localized to Signal inbound processing and follow established multi-media patterns (MediaPaths/Types/Urls). Main risk is around small edge cases: constructing `group:${groupId}` without guarding against undefined and UI placeholder counts using total attachments vs valid/fetched attachments.

## Comments

### @ProofOfReach (2026-02-02)

Addressed the review feedback in 668e55a:

- **P1**: Added guard to prevent `group:undefined` target when `groupId` is missing
- **P2**: Changed placeholder count to use `mediaPaths.length` instead of `attachments.length` for accuracy

Core CI checks (node, bun, lint, android, windows) are passing. macOS checks appear to be queued.
