## Description

## Summary
- Fixes #4689
- When `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode` is `"off"`, `tools.exec.host` now correctly defaults to `"gateway"` instead of `"sandbox"`
- Previously, exec would spawn Docker containers even with sandbox disabled, causing port conflicts and session desync

## Changes
- `bash-tools.exec.ts`: Check if sandbox config exists before defaulting to sandbox host
- Updated tests to use `security: "full"` to bypass approval (gateway exec requires approval)

## Test plan
- [x] All bash-tools tests pass
- [x] Linter passes

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts `tools.exec.host` defaulting so that when the agent sandbox is disabled (`agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "off"` / no sandbox config), `exec` runs on the gateway by default instead of attempting to spawn sandbox Docker containers. Tests were updated to set `security: "full"` where needed to bypass gateway approval prompts now that the default host may be `gateway`.

This change fits into the bash tools by aligning host selection (`sandbox` vs `gateway`) with the presence/absence of sandbox configuration, preventing unexpected Docker usage and associated port/session conflicts when sandboxing is turned off.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge with low functional risk.
- The core change is a small, localized defaulting tweak to exec host selection that better matches sandbox configuration, and the accompanying test updates reflect the new default. Main remaining risk is subtle behavior changes if `defaults.sandbox` can be set while sandbox mode is "off" (inconsistent config), which could still default to sandbox unexpectedly, but that seems unlikely given typical config construction.
