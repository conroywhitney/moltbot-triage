## Description

## Summary

Fixes #5691

- Fixes runtime detection for versioned Node binaries like `node24` (openSUSE) and `node-22`
- On openSUSE, Node.js is installed as `/usr/bin/node24` (no hyphen), which wasn't recognized
- This caused gateway service generation and CLI argument parsing to fail

## Changes

- Create shared `src/daemon/runtime-detect.ts` module with `isNodeRuntime()` and `isBunRuntime()`
- Fix regex pattern: `/^node-\d+/` → `/^node-?\d+/` (make hyphen optional)
- Remove duplicate implementations from `program-args.ts` and `service-audit.ts`
- Fix same pattern in `src/cli/argv.ts` for CLI argument parsing
- Add comprehensive tests (11 test cases)

## Test plan

- [x] Tested on openSUSE server with `/usr/bin/node24`
- [x] Gateway service runs without workarounds
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] `pnpm format && pnpm lint && pnpm build && pnpm test` passes

**`src/cli/argv.ts`**
[P2] `buildParseArgv()` still duplicates runtime detection logic (node/bun executable name matching) instead of using the new shared `runtime-detect.ts` helpers.

This isn’t incorrect, but it means future tweaks (e.g., adding another supported binary name) must be kept in sync across `src/cli/argv.ts` and `src/daemon/runtime-detect.ts`. Consider reusing the shared helper (or extracting an `isNodeExecutableName()` that both can share) to avoid drift.
