<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR hardens `SearchableSelectList` rendering and highlighting so search highlighting doesn’t corrupt ANSI escape sequences (avoiding TUI crashes when a query partially matches escape codes). It does this by splitting text into ANSI vs visible segments before applying highlights, and by truncating rendered lines using `pi-tui`’s `visibleWidth`/`truncateToWidth` so ANSI styling is preserved.

The changes are localized to `src/tui/components/searchable-select-list.ts` and affect how list item labels/descriptions are highlighted and width-constrained, plus some minor input-handling guards.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and addresses a real crash class, with a couple of edge cases worth checking.
- The change is self-contained and improves ANSI-safety in highlighting and truncation, but the ANSI regex is narrow (SGR-only) and may miss other escape sequences, and there’s a small type/logic inconsistency (`items ?? []`) that should be clarified.
- src/tui/components/searchable-select-list.ts
