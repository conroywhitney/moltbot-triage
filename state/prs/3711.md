## Description

Hardens the network security policy for both iOS and macOS applications by removing the ability to load arbitrary insecure HTTP content. Only local networking (for gateway communication) and explicitly whitelisted domains are now allowed via HTTP.

### Changes
- Replaces `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent` with `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` in iOS Info.plist
- Replaces `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent` with `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` in macOS Info.plist

This aligns with best practices for limiting attack surface while maintaining necessary local gateway functionality.
