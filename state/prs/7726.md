## Description

FLock.io is a privacy-preserving AI training platform that combines federated learning with blockchain-based verification. Through its API Platform, developers get access to community-validated open-source models with transparent, on-chain performance metrics — all via an OpenAI-compatible API.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds new provider documentation page `docs/providers/flock.md` describing how to use FLock.io’s OpenAI-compatible API with OpenClaw, including setup/auth steps, model recommendations, supported parameters, and an example config snippet mapping FLock models.

The change fits the existing docs/providers pattern (a per-provider page that complements the central provider index), but the new page is not currently linked from `docs/providers/index.md`, which may reduce discoverability.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; issues are limited to documentation accuracy and discoverability.
- Only a new docs page is added; no runtime behavior changes. The main concerns are (1) the new provider page not being linked from the providers index and (2) an internal inconsistency in the documented context window vs the config example, which could mislead users.
- docs/providers/flock.md; docs/providers/index.md

**`docs/providers/index.md`**
[P1] New provider doc isn’t linked from the providers index

`docs/providers/flock.md` is added in this PR, but `/docs/providers/index.md`’s “Provider docs” list doesn’t include FLock. That makes the new documentation hard to discover from the main providers landing page; consider adding `FLock.io` to this list (wherever you keep the ordering).
