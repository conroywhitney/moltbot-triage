## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Ollama provider documentation to add a quick-start prerequisite reminding users to enable Ollama’s “Expose Ollama to the network” setting, and renumbers the subsequent quick-start steps accordingly. This fits into the docs/providers section by clarifying a common connectivity/setup requirement for OpenClaw’s Ollama integration.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low-risk and safe to merge, with one likely-overbroad docs instruction to consider adjusting.
- Change is documentation-only and limited to quick-start step text/renumbering; the main concern is that the new prerequisite may mislead users and encourages a less secure configuration when not needed.
- docs/providers/ollama.md
