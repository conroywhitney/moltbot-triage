## Description

## Summary

Plugins can now include a `setupGuide` field in `clawdbot.plugin.json` that will be displayed after installation.

## Motivation

When a plugin is installed, users only see "Installed plugin: xxx". For plugins requiring additional configuration (like channel plugins needing API credentials), there's no built-in way to guide users through setup.

## Changes

- Add `setupGuide?: string` to `PluginManifest` type
- Parse `setupGuide` from plugin manifest
- Display after successful plugin installation

## Usage

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "setupGuide": "Next steps:\n1. Get API key...\n2. Add to config...",
  "configSchema": { }
}
```
