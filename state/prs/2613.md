## Description

## Summary
Adds a `--url` option to the `moltbot agent` command to allow connecting to a remote/Dockerized gateway, and updates documentation to correctly explain the Docker pairing workflow.

## Changes
- **CLI**: Added `--url` / `-u` flag to `moltbot agent`.
- **Docs**: Updated `docs/install/docker.md` to remove incorrect "Settings -> Token" instruction and document correct `moltbot devices approve` workflow.
- **Gateway**: Updated error message to suggest `moltbot devices approve` instead of non-existent UI settings.

## Degree of Testing
- [x] Fully tested
- [x] Manual verification of CLI flag functionality
- [x] Manual verification of EPERM fix in hooks
- [x] Unit tests added for `agent-via-gateway`

## AI Attribution
