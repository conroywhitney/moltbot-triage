## Description

## Summary

Signal group IDs are base64-encoded and case-sensitive. `normalizeSignalMessagingTarget()` was calling `.toLowerCase()` on the entire `group:{id}` string, corrupting the base64 group ID and causing "Group not found" errors.

## Changes

- **`src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.ts`**: Remove `.toLowerCase()` from the `group:` branch, preserving the original base64 case
- **`src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.test.ts`**: Add test cases for base64 group ID case preservation (with and without `signal:` prefix)

## Before

```
group:mJ6qA3MrX09n1PzxIhv1u3KWKd/eDiNoWY0Hy1z2jas=
→ group:mj6qa3mrx09n1pzxihv1u3kwkd/edinowy0hy1z2jas=  ← broken
```

## After

```
group:mJ6qA3MrX09n1PzxIhv1u3KWKd/eDiNoWY0Hy1z2jas=
→ group:mJ6qA3MrX09n1PzxIhv1u3KWKd/eDiNoWY0Hy1z2jas=  ← preserved
```

Fixes #7354

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes Signal target normalization to avoid lowercasing `group:{id}` targets, which preserves the case-sensitive base64 group ID and prevents “Group not found” errors. It also adds Vitest coverage to assert case preservation for `group:` targets with and without a `signal:` prefix.

Within the codebase, this change is isolated to the `src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.ts` normalizer used by Signal channel routing/dispatch to canonicalize user-supplied target strings, and the colocated test file ensures the behavior stays stable.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge after removing an accidental log file from the changeset.
- The functional change is small and directly covered by new unit tests, and it aligns with Signal base64 group ID case-sensitivity. The only notable issue is the inclusion of a likely-unintended debug log file in the repo root.
