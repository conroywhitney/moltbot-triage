## Description

## Problem

The `tts` tool outputs `MEDIA:/tmp/tts-xxx/voice.opus` as text instead of delivering the audio file.

## Root Cause

Security fix #4880 blocked all absolute paths in `isValidMedia()` to prevent LFI. However, this also blocked paths generated by internal tools like TTS, which write to `/tmp/tts-*/`.

## Fix

Whitelist trusted internal tool output paths:
- `/tmp/tts-*` (TTS audio files)
- `/tmp/openclaw-*` (other internal tool outputs)

These paths are generated by OpenClaw internally, not from user input, so they don't pose an LFI risk.

## Tests

- ✅ `accepts trusted internal TTS paths`
- ✅ `accepts trusted internal openclaw paths`
- ✅ `still rejects other absolute paths` (e.g. `/tmp/evil/`)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `src/media/parse.ts` to accept MEDIA tokens pointing at internally-generated temp files under `/tmp/tts-*` and `/tmp/openclaw-*`, and adds tests in `src/media/parse.test.ts` to confirm those paths are accepted while other absolute paths remain blocked.

The main integration point is `splitMediaFromOutput()`, which uses `isValidMedia()` to decide which MEDIA payloads become `mediaUrls` for later loading (e.g., via `src/web/media.ts` local `fs.readFile`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is because it likely reintroduces a local file read primitive via the new `/tmp/*` allowlist.
- The change broadly trusts any path with a `/tmp/tts-` or `/tmp/openclaw-` prefix without constraining traversal (`..`) or symlink escapes; downstream code reads local paths directly, so a crafted MEDIA token could lead to sensitive file reads in environments where an attacker can influence tool output.
- src/media/parse.ts (allowlist logic); also consider how callers load local media (src/web/media.ts)
