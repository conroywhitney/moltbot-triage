## Description

## Fix browser set headers CLI option collision

### Background

The `browser set headers` command previously the `--json` option to accept
header input. However, the parent `browser` command already defines the `--json` flag for controlling output format.

This option name collision resulted in ambiguous parsing behavior across different invocation environments, causing the headers input to be misinterpreted or ignored.

---

### Changes

This PR addresses the issue by:

- **Disambiguating CLI options**
  - Rename the headers input option from `--json` to `--headers-json` with a more specific naming
  - Clearly separate header input semantics from the parent output formatting flag

- **Clarifying CLI usage**
  - Update command usage to reflect the new option name and expected input value type as a JSON string

---

### Example Usage

```bash
openclaw browser set headers  --headers-json '{"User-Agent":"my-agent"}'
```

---

### Follow-up

The official documentation needs to update seprately to reflect this naming change. And this is **important**.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the `browser set headers` subcommand to avoid a flag-name collision with the parent `browser --json` output flag by renaming the header-input option from `--json` to `--headers-json` in `src/cli/browser-cli-state.ts`.

However, the implementation currently still reads the payload from `opts.json`, so the renamed flag will not be honored and the command is likely broken until it reads `opts.headersJson` (commander camel-cases option names).

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is because the renamed CLI flag is not actually wired up in the handler.
- Although the intent (avoid `--json` collision) is correct, the handler still parses `opts.json` instead of the new commander option property, so the primary functionality likely breaks at runtime for users of `--headers-json`.
