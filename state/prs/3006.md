<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `scripts/run-node.mjs` to prefer a local `pnpm` binary from `node_modules/.bin` when available, improving the reliability of the TypeScript build step in environments without a global pnpm install. The change affects the “dist is stale” build path that spawns pnpm to run the configured TS compiler before running the built entrypoint.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but the intended pnpm fallback is currently ineffective on Windows.
- Change is small and localized to the build-spawn path, but there is a functional gap on Windows where `cmd.exe /c pnpm ...` still requires a global pnpm and ignores the computed local pnpm path; non-Windows behavior should work as intended.
- scripts/run-node.mjs (Windows spawn args)
