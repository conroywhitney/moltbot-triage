## Description

When someone reply to a post created by moltbot in slack, moltbot will then reply it, but when reply, moltbot lost the orignal post's content, so it don't know what the user is talking about.

Fix Slack thread context so Moltbot replies in threads include the original starter even when the thread inherits the parent session. Add per-thread starter tracking to avoid repeating context across replies, and improve Slack thread starter extraction for non-text starters (blocks/files/attachments).
