## Description

## Summary

When streaming is aborted mid-tool-call, the assistant message contains a `toolCall` with `partialJson` (incomplete arguments) instead of complete `arguments`. The repair logic was creating synthetic `tool_results` for these incomplete calls, but since the incomplete `tool_use` blocks are skipped during API conversion, this caused "unexpected tool_use_id" errors from the Anthropic API.

## Changes

- Updated `extractToolCallsFromAssistant()` to skip tool calls that have `partialJson` but no `arguments` field
- Added 2 test cases to verify the fix

## Test plan

- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] New tests verify incomplete tool calls are skipped
- [x] Verified gateway starts without crash after clearing corrupted session

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the session transcript repair logic to ignore incomplete streamed tool calls that contain `partialJson` but no `arguments`. This prevents the repair step from inserting synthetic `toolResult` messages for tool calls that will later be omitted during Anthropic API conversion, avoiding "unexpected tool_use_id" validation errors. Two Vitest cases were added to cover skipping incomplete tool calls and ensuring synthetic results are still generated for complete calls.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Change is narrowly scoped to filtering incomplete streamed tool calls and is covered by new focused tests; it does not alter tool result pairing logic for valid calls.
- No files require special attention
