<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes cron startup behavior so a persisted `state.nextRunAtMs` is preserved across restarts (keeping missed runs due), adds a regression test that simulates restart with a persisted store, and notes the fix in the changelog.

Key logic change is in `src/cron/service/jobs.ts` where `recomputeNextRuns` now only computes `nextRunAtMs` when it’s missing/invalid, rather than overwriting the stored value on startup; the new test validates that behavior by creating a job, stopping the service, advancing time past the scheduled run, and ensuring the restored job keeps the original `nextRunAtMs`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is largely safe to merge; the behavior change is localized and has a targeted regression test.
- The change is small and scoped to cron schedule recomputation, and the new test covers the restart regression. Remaining concerns are limited to minor release-note accuracy and test hygiene (temp dir cleanup) rather than runtime correctness.
- CHANGELOG.md; src/cron/service.keeps-next-run-on-restart.test.ts
