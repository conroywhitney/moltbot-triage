## Description

Currently, the config page in the dashboard is not scrollable. This PR fixes the CSS to enable scrolling.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the config page layout CSS by removing `overflow: hidden` from `.config-layout`, allowing the dashboard config page content to scroll when it exceeds the viewport. The rest of the config page styling (sidebar, content area, cards, and mobile breakpoints) remains unchanged, and scrolling continues to be handled by `.config-content { overflow-y: auto; }`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Single-line CSS change that removes a clipping overflow rule; it’s localized to the config page layout container and aligns with existing scroll behavior on `.config-content`.
- No files require special attention

Thanks for the fix! The CSS change looks correct, but this PR needs a couple of adjustments before it can be merged:

1. **Remove `package-lock.json`** - This project uses pnpm, not npm. The lock file adds 13,396 lines and shouldn't be committed. You can remove it with:
```bash
git rm package-lock.json
git commit --amend
git push --force
```
2. Delete the line instead of commenting - Rather than /* overflow: hidden; */, just remove the line entirely. Commented-out code adds noise.

The actual fix (enabling scroll on config page) is valid and needed!

Thanks for the feedback!
I removed the commented out line and also deleted the package-lock.json file.
