## Description

Adds native support for Voyage AI embedding models, including correct Batch API integration (12h window) and shared embedding space compatibility.

Voyage AI provides State-of-the-Art (SOTA) embedding models that significantly improve retrieval quality for agents. Additionally, the new Voyage 4 series architecture allows for shared embedding spaces. This PR lays the foundation for future local execution using the `voyage-4-nano` model, which will be a major benefit to users once GGUF/quantization support is finalized in the ecosystem.
