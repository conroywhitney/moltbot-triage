## Description

Removed redundant chown command for workspace directory.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR simplifies the Hetzner Docker setup doc by removing a redundant `chown` call for `/root/.openclaw/workspace`, relying on the existing recursive `chown -R 1000:1000 /root/.openclaw` to cover the workspace directory as well.

This keeps the “create persistent host directories” step shorter while preserving the intended ownership semantics for the host-mounted config/workspace paths.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a documentation-only simplification that removes a clearly redundant command while preserving the same resulting ownership state via the remaining recursive `chown` on the parent directory.
- No files require special attention
