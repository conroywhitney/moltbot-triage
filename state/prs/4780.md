## Description

`openclaw models status` always resolves the default agent's directory, so there's no way to inspect a named agent's auth profiles, models.json, or usage stats without overriding `OPENCLAW_AGENT_DIR`.

This adds `--agent <id>` to `models status` (and the bare `models` shortcut), following the same pattern already used by `models auth order get/set/clear`. When provided, the status command resolves the named agent's directory via `resolveAgentDir()` and shows that agent's auth store, profiles, and usage data.

```sh
openclaw models status --agent jeremiah
openclaw models status --agent jeremiah --json
```
