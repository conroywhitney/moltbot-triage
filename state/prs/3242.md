## Description

## Summary
Adds support for self-hosted SearXNG instances as a `web_search` provider.

## Changes
- Add `searxng` to `SEARCH_PROVIDERS`
- Add SearXNG config type and resolution functions
- Implement `runSearxngSearch()` with JSON API support
- Update Zod schema for `tools.web.search.searxng.baseUrl`
- Add config help text for SearXNG options

## Configuration
```yaml
tools:
  web:
    search:
      provider: searxng
      searxng:
        baseUrl: https://search.example.com
```

Or via environment variable: `SEARXNG_BASE_URL`

## Why?
SearXNG is a popular self-hosted metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple sources. Unlike Brave or Perplexity, it:
- Requires no API key
- Can be self-hosted for privacy
- Returns structured JSON via `?format=json`
- Aggregates from Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave, and more

## Testing
Tested against a self-hosted SearXNG instance. The response format is compatible with the existing result structure (title, url, description, score).
