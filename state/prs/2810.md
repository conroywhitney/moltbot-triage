## Description

## Problem

When the gateway restarts, `loadActiveCalls()` reloads non-terminal calls from `calls.jsonl`. However, these calls may have already ended (e.g., Twilio timed them out) and are now stale. This causes the concurrent call limit to be reached with phantom calls that can never be cleared.

## Solution

Skip loading calls that are older than `maxDurationSeconds`, as they cannot possibly still be active.

## Testing

1. Initiate a call
2. Kill the gateway before the call ends  
3. Restart the gateway
4. Verify that stale calls are logged as skipped
5. Verify that new calls can be initiated

Fixes calls getting stuck in 'initiated' state after gateway restarts.
