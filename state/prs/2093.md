## Description

Enhance FTS query building to support CJK detection and improve token extraction. This will support languages like Chinese/Japanese/Korean.

Currently only English is supported for hybird scoring.

Set temporary option for supporting Chinese/Japanese/Korean languages.

We may also need reranker.

Also, I wonder this linear blend in `score = vectorWeight * vectorScore + textWeight * textScore` can be a potential issue later.
