## Description

## Summary
- detect Slack Canvas shares and pull content into inbound context (best-effort)
- add Slack canvas actions (create/update) gated by channels.slack.actions.canvases
- add canvas limits config + docs updates for scopes and limits
- add canvas helper + tests for detection/fetch + inbound injection

## Testing
- not run (unit/e2e)

## Manual verification
1) Add scopes: files:read, canvases:read, canvases:write (plus existing). Reinstall the Slack app.
2) Ensure Socket Mode works (app-level token with connections:write).
3) Create/share a canvas in a channel where the bot is present.
4) Post a message with the canvas link/file. Verify Clawdbot context includes a [Slack Canvas: ...] block or a short diagnostic.
5) Ask Clawdbot to create a canvas (e.g., "create a canvas titled X with Y"). Verify canvas creation.
6) Ask Clawdbot to update a canvas (by canvasId or channelId) and verify edits.
