## Description

## Summary
- detect Slack Canvas shares and pull content into inbound context (best-effort)
- add Slack canvas actions (create/update) gated by channels.slack.actions.canvases
- add canvas limits config + docs updates for scopes and limits
- add canvas helper + tests for detection/fetch + inbound injection

## Testing
- not run (unit/e2e)

## Manual verification
1) Add scopes: files:read, canvases:read, canvases:write (plus existing). Reinstall the Slack app.
2) Ensure Socket Mode works (app-level token with connections:write).
3) Create/share a canvas in a channel where the bot is present.
4) Post a message with the canvas link/file. Verify Clawdbot context includes a [Slack Canvas: ...] block or a short diagnostic.
5) Ask Clawdbot to create a canvas (e.g., "create a canvas titled X with Y"). Verify canvas creation.
6) Ask Clawdbot to update a canvas (by canvasId or channelId) and verify edits.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds Slack Canvas support in two places:

- **Inbound ingestion**: detects canvas shares/files on incoming Slack messages, fetches the associated file content via `files.info` + `url_private_download`, and injects a best-effort `[Slack Canvas: ...]` block into the inbound prompt context with configurable byte/char limits.
- **Outbound actions**: introduces new Slack actions for `createCanvas` / `updateCanvas`, gated behind `channels.slack.actions.canvases`, plus corresponding config schema/types and docs updates.

Overall the changes fit the existing Slack monitor + action-gating architecture (monitor context carries limits; tools route through `handleSlackAction`; channel plugins advertise actions based on config).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge after fixing the `listPins` credential-selection bug.
- The changes are additive and follow existing Slack monitor/action patterns, with tests included for canvas detection/fetch and inbound injection. The main issue found is a concrete logic bug in `handleSlackAction` where `listPins` may ignore `readOpts` unless `writeOpts` is set, which can break expected auth behavior. Remaining notes are performance/robustness considerations rather than correctness blockers.
- src/agents/tools/slack-actions.ts (pin listing opts), src/slack/canvases.ts (recursive traversal robustness)

[P0] `listPins` passes `readOpts` only when `writeOpts` is set

In the `listPins` branch you gate passing `readOpts` on `writeOpts` (`const pins = writeOpts ? await listSlackPins(channelId, readOpts) : ...`). This will drop the user-token/accountId overrides for read operations whenever write is disabled (e.g. user token is read-only or no bot token), causing `listPins` to run with default credentials unexpectedly.

This should likely be `readOpts ? await listSlackPins(channelId, readOpts) : await listSlackPins(channelId)`.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
