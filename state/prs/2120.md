## Description

## Summary

- Fix `validateProviderConfig()` to check environment variables as fallback before reporting missing credentials
- Previously, validation would fail even when `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, etc. were set via env vars

## Problem

The voice-call plugin's `runtime.ts` already resolves credentials from env vars as fallback (lines 40-65), but `validateProviderConfig()` in `config.ts` runs first and reports errors without checking env vars.

This meant deployments using env vars for secrets (the recommended secure approach) would see confusing validation errors like:
```
plugins.entries.voice-call.config.twilio.accountSid is required (or set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID env)
```
...even when `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` was correctly set.

## Changes

Added `process.env.*` fallback checks for all provider credentials:
- Twilio: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Telnyx: `TELNYX_API_KEY`, `TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID`
- Plivo: `PLIVO_AUTH_ID`, `PLIVO_AUTH_TOKEN`

## Test plan

- [ ] Deploy with credentials in env vars only (empty `twilio: {}` in config)
- [ ] Verify no validation errors on startup
- [ ] Verify calls work correctly
