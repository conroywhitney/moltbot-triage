1. **Summary**:  
   This PR updates the documentation in `SKILL.md`, changing all references from `~/.clawdbot/` to `~/.openclaw/` for session log paths. It also fixes a minor apostrophe formatting issue in the "Trigger" section.

2. **Analysis**:  
   - The changes appear purely **documentational** with no functional code modifications.  
   - The path updates (`clawdbot` → `openclaw`) are applied consistently across all code snippets and descriptions.  
   - The apostrophe fix (`isn’t` → `isn't`) resolves inconsistent typography.  
   - No bugs introduced, as no logic/behavior changes exist.  

3. **Verdict**:  
   **APPROVE**  
   The PR achieves its implied goal (updating directory references). No issues detected.
