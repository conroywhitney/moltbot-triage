## Description

## Summary

The Slack extension's `handleAction` for `action='read'` was not passing the `threadId` parameter to `handleSlackAction`, causing thread reads to return main channel messages instead of thread replies.

## Problem

When calling:
```
message action=read channel=slack channelId=CCNNNLEMN threadId=1769960252.206929 limit=3
```

The `threadId` parameter was being dropped in `extensions/slack/src/channel.ts`, so the Slack API's `conversations.history` was called instead of `conversations.replies`, returning main channel messages rather than thread replies.

## Fix

Added the missing `threadId: readStringParam(params, "threadId")` to the read action handler in the Slack extension plugin.

## Testing

Tested locally - thread reads now correctly return thread replies with `thread_ts` matching the requested thread.

Fixes #6363

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes Slack `read` action handling by forwarding the `threadId` parameter from `extensions/slack/src/channel.ts` into `handleSlackAction` for `readMessages`, allowing the Slack runtime to fetch thread replies (via `conversations.replies`) instead of falling back to channel history when a thread read is requested.

The change is localized to the Slack channel plugin’s action dispatcher and aligns the `read` path with other actions (e.g., `send` already forwards thread context via `threadTs`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s a minimal, targeted bug fix with low regression risk.
- The change only adds a missing parameter pass-through in the Slack action dispatcher and does not alter control flow or shared logic; it aligns with existing parameter forwarding patterns used elsewhere in the same file.
- No files require special attention
