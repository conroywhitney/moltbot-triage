## Description

This updates the docs to recommend using the *managed + isolated* openclaw browser profile as the default for stability.

- Suggests setting browser.defaultProfile: "openclaw" for day-to-day agent browsing/automation.
- Clarifies that chrome is the *extension relay* profile and requires attaching a tab via the OpenClaw Browser Relay toolbar icon (badge ON).
- Keeps the relay flow as an explicit choice when you want to drive your existing browser session.

No runtime / behavior changes — documentation only.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates browser-related documentation to recommend using the OpenClaw-managed `openclaw` browser profile as the default (`browser.defaultProfile: "openclaw"`) for day-to-day automation, and clarifies that the `chrome` profile is specifically for the Browser Relay extension flow (requires manually attaching a tab via the extension toolbar icon/badge).

Changes are limited to docs (`docs/gateway/configuration.md`, `docs/tools/browser.md`, `docs/tools/index.md`) and align the configuration snippet and tool reference notes around the new recommended default.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it is documentation-only and internally consistent.
- Reviewed all diffs in the three modified docs files and checked for consistency with other docs references to `browser.defaultProfile` and the Browser Relay attachment flow. No broken internal links, misleading defaults, or conflicting guidance introduced.
- No files require special attention
