## Description

Currently OpenAI's RateLimit error is being classified as a ContextLimit error resulting in undefined behaviors. 

This is because 'Request Rate limit reached for gpt-5.2 in organization org-xxx on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 500000, Used 362512, Requested 153920. Please try again in 1.971s' is matching CONTEXT_OVERFLOW_HINT_RE. 

The fix is simple, we should exclude RateLimit errors from ContextLimit errors
