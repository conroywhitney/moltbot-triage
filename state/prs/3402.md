## Description

## Summary
Agents often mistakenly try to use boolean operators (OR/AND) in Discord search queries, expecting SQL-like or web-search behavior. Discord's search API matches queries literally as phrases.

## Changes
Added a note to the Discord skill's search section clarifying this limitation and suggesting separate calls for multiple terms.

## AI-assisted
- **Tool:** Claude
- **Testing level:** Lightly tested (documentation-only change)
- **Understanding:** Yes, this is a simple doc clarification based on observed agent behavior

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Discord skill documentation (`skills/discord/SKILL.md`) by adding a note in the message search section clarifying that Discord search does not support boolean operators like `OR`/`AND` and that queries are matched literally; it recommends issuing separate searches for multiple terms. This fits into the repo’s skill docs as guidance to reduce common agent/user misuse of `searchMessages` queries.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Documentation-only change localized to the Discord skill docs; no code paths or tooling behavior are modified, and the added note is consistent with the described Discord search limitation.
- No files require special attention
