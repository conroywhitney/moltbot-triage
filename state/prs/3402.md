## Description

## Summary
Agents often mistakenly try to use boolean operators (OR/AND) in Discord search queries, expecting SQL-like or web-search behavior. Discord's search API matches queries literally as phrases.

## Changes
Added a note to the Discord skill's search section clarifying this limitation and suggesting separate calls for multiple terms.
