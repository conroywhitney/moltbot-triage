## Description

- Added `dist/entry.js` to the npm package to prevent global install failures.
- Introduced a new `verify-package.js` script to verify the presence of critical files before publishing.
- Updated the `prepack` script in `package.json` to include the verification step.

Issue #3914

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the npm package contents and publish flow by:
- Adding `dist/entry.js` to the `files` allowlist so it’s included in the published tarball.
- Adding a new `scripts/verify-package.js` step to the `prepack` script to fail fast if critical publish artifacts are missing.
- Adding a small Vitest test that asserts `package.json` includes the new file and `prepack` runs verification.

The intent aligns with prior packaging fixes in this repo (preventing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on install), but the verification step currently appears to require an artifact (`dist/entry.js`) that isn’t produced by the build in this repository, which could make `prepack`/packing fail until the build pipeline generates it.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is close to safe to merge, but may break the publish/pack flow if `dist/entry.js` is not actually generated.
- The change is small and isolated, but `prepack` is now gated on a new verification script that asserts `dist/entry.js` exists; a repo-wide search did not find any `dist/**` source for that file, suggesting `prepack`/`pnpm pack` would fail unless another step creates it.
- scripts/verify-package.js, package.json
