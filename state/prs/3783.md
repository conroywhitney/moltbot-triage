<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the project’s CLI naming to align with the Moltbot rebrand:

- **Docs:** Removes “formerly `clawdbot` …” language in the security audit quick-check section and drops the note about older installs.
- **Packaging:** Removes the `clawdbot` binary alias from `package.json`, leaving only the `moltbot` CLI entry.

These changes affect end-user command invocation (what executable name is available after install) and the docs that instruct users how to run the security audit.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Generally safe to merge, but may be a breaking CLI change for existing users.
- The diff is small (docs + package metadata), but removing a published CLI binary alias can break user scripts and automation. There’s also a minor documentation consistency risk around still-referenced legacy environment variable names.
- package.json (CLI alias removal) and docs/gateway/security/index.md (naming/env var consistency)

[P1] `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` env var looks stale after rebrand

This snippet still references `${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD}` even though this doc now consistently uses Moltbot naming and the PR removes the legacy `clawdbot` CLI alias. If the runtime env var was also renamed (common in rebrands), this example will mislead users and break copy/paste setups.

If the env var is intentionally still `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` for compatibility, it’s worth explicitly calling that out in the doc to avoid confusion.

[P0] Removing `clawdbot` bin alias may break existing installs/scripts

Dropping the `clawdbot` entry from `bin` is a breaking change for anyone with existing scripts, docs, or automation still calling `clawdbot ...`. If the intent is to keep backwards compatibility for a while, consider keeping the alias (or providing a stub that prints a deprecation warning). If the intent is an intentional breaking change, it should be called out in release notes / migration docs so users aren’t surprised.
