## Description

Related #1926

Signal mentions were appearing as ￼ (object replacement character) instead of readable identifiers. This caused Clawdbot to misinterpret messages and respond inappropriately.

Now parses dataMessage.mentions array and replaces the placeholder character with @{uuid} or @{phone} from the mention metadata.

It turns out it's very difficult to display the actual contact name, but displaying the UUID at least allows Clawdbot to differentiate between users who are being mentioned.
