## Description

## Summary

This PR adds the raw request body string to the webhook transform context, enabling proper HMAC signature verification in custom transforms.

## Problem

Webhook providers (Zoho, GitHub, Stripe, etc.) sign their payloads with HMAC. To verify these signatures, the transform function needs access to the **exact raw body string** that was signed, not the parsed JSON object.

Currently, `applyHookMappings` receives only `{ payload, headers, url, path }` - the parsed payload loses the original string representation needed for HMAC verification.

## Solution

1. Modified `readJsonBody()` in `hooks.ts` to return `rawBody` alongside the parsed value
2. Added `rawBody?: string` to `HookMappingContext` type in `hooks-mapping.ts`
3. Pass `rawBody` through to `applyHookMappings()` in `server-http.ts`
4. Support `{{rawBody}}` template expression in transforms

## Usage

In a transform script:
```javascript
export default async function transform(ctx) {
  const signature = ctx.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  const computed = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(ctx.rawBody).digest('hex');
  if (signature !== computed) {
    return { action: null }; // reject invalid signature
  }
  // ... process valid webhook
}
```

Or in template mappings:
```json
{
  "message": "Raw body: {{rawBody}}"
}
```

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR threads the request’s raw JSON body through the hooks pipeline by:
- Extending `readJsonBody` to return `{ value, rawBody }`.
- Adding `rawBody?: string` to `HookMappingContext` and exposing it in template rendering via `{{rawBody}}`.
- Passing the `rawBody` from `server-http` into `applyHookMappings` so transform scripts can do HMAC verification.

Overall, it fits cleanly into the existing hooks mapping/transform architecture by enriching the mapping context without changing mapping resolution or dispatch behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but the new `rawBody` value is not actually raw due to trimming, which can break intended HMAC verification use-cases.
- The change is small and localized to hooks request parsing and mapping context. However, the `.trim()` on the stored `rawBody` is a functional mismatch with the PR’s stated goal (byte-for-byte payload needed for signature verification) and can cause false signature failures depending on provider/payload formatting.
