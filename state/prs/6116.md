## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `resolveOptionFromCommand` (`src/cli/cli-utils.ts`) to explicitly assert the option value type (`opts[key] as T`) when walking up the commander `Command` parent chain. The behavior at runtime is unchanged; the change is purely for TypeScript typing to align the generic return type `T | undefined` with commander’s untyped `opts()` return shape.

I didn’t find any new functional issues introduced by this change. In current call sites (e.g. `src/cli/models-cli.ts`), callers already treat the returned value as a string/undefined, so the assertion matches existing usage.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a narrow TypeScript-only type assertion in a helper that reads commander options; it does not alter runtime control flow or values, and current usage aligns with the asserted types.
- No files require special attention
