## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR performs small documentation cleanups: it removes stray citation artifacts from `docs/tts.md` and updates the Chinese docs acknowledgements in `docs/zh-CN/index.md` to use `x.com` instead of `twitter.com` profile links.

These changes are isolated to docs content and don’t affect runtime behavior, but they do impact link correctness and reader experience in the Mintlify-hosted documentation.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; changes are isolated to documentation text and links.
- Only minor Markdown/link updates were made, with low risk of affecting the product. The main remaining concerns are doc rendering consistency (list formatting) and whether `x.com` is the desired canonical domain for social links.
- docs/tts.md (Markdown list rendering); docs/zh-CN/index.md (link canonicalization decision)
