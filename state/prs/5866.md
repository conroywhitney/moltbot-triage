## Description

## Summary
- Adds a new `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO` build arg to the Dockerfile
- When set, configures Docker's official APT repository (download.docker.com) with proper GPG key verification
- Plumbs the arg through `docker-setup.sh` (export, `.env` persistence, `--build-arg`)
- Documents the feature in `docs/install/docker.md` (quick-reference list + dedicated subsection with usage example)

The repo step runs before `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES`, so packages like `docker-ce-cli` can be installed in the same build.

## Test plan
- [x] Build image without the arg — no change in behavior
- [x] Build with `--build-arg OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO=1` — Docker official repo is added
- [x] Build with both args (e.g. `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO=1 OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES=docker-ce-cli`) — package installs successfully
- [x] Run `docker-setup.sh` with `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO=1` exported — value persists in `.env` and is passed to build

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds an optional `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO` build arg to the root `Dockerfile` and plumbs it through `docker-setup.sh` so users can opt into Docker’s official APT repository during image builds. Documentation in `docs/install/docker.md` is updated to describe the new env var and how it composes with `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES` (repo configured first so packages like `docker-ce-cli` can be installed in the same build).

Overall this fits cleanly into the existing Docker setup flow: `docker-setup.sh` persists env vars into `.env` and forwards them as `--build-arg`s, while the Dockerfile conditionally adds the repository and key before the existing “install extra apt packages” hook runs.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; changes are scoped and mostly additive.
- Main functional path remains unchanged unless the new build arg is set. The primary concerns are maintainability/security-hardening details in the Docker APT repo setup (hard-coded Debian codename; key download not fingerprint-verified).
- Dockerfile (APT repo configuration and key handling).

**`docker-setup.sh`**
[P3] `.env` persistence writes empty values for optional vars.

With `upsert_env`, exporting `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO`/`OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES` as empty still causes keys to be written (e.g. `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_OFFICIAL_REPO=`) (`docker-setup.sh:162-173`). That’s consistent with current behavior, but it can surprise users expecting “unset means absent”. If `.env` parsing elsewhere treats empty vs missing differently, this can subtly change behavior.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Re P3 (empty `.env` values): this is consistent with how every other optional var in `docker-setup.sh` already works (e.g. `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES`, `OPENCLAW_EXTRA_MOUNTS`, `OPENCLAW_HOME_VOLUME` all write empty values when unset). The `upsert_env` function treats all listed keys uniformly, and Docker Compose / shell both treat empty and absent the same way for these vars (`-n ""` is falsy). Changing this behavior for just our new var would be inconsistent, and changing it for all vars is a separate concern outside the scope of this PR.
