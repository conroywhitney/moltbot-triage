## Description

- Adds iointelligence from ionet as inference provider in OpenClaw

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new `io-intelligence` inference provider: it wires up env var resolution (`IO_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY`), adds an implicit provider config with OpenAI-compatible base URL and a small model catalog, and extends the onboarding/auth-choice flow and docs to support selecting IO Intelligence and setting it as the default model.

The integration follows existing provider patterns (provider config in `src/agents/models-config.providers.ts`, onboarding config helpers in `src/commands/onboard-auth.config-core.ts`, and new auth-choice option/group in `src/commands/auth-choice-options.ts`).

Main concern: the new `ioIntelligenceApiKey` option and documented `--io-intelligence-api-key` flag don’t appear to be wired into the onboarding logic, so the non-interactive CLI path may not actually persist credentials/config as documented.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge, but the io-intelligence non-interactive onboarding flag path looks broken/incomplete.
- Core provider wiring (env var mapping, implicit provider config, auth-choice handling) is consistent with existing patterns, but the new `ioIntelligenceApiKey` option appears unused and docs reference a `--io-intelligence-api-key` CLI flag that likely won’t work, which will frustrate users and break advertised setup flows.
- src/commands/onboard-types.ts, docs/providers/io-intelligence.md, and wherever onboard CLI flags are parsed/applied

**`src/commands/onboard-types.ts`**
`ioIntelligenceApiKey?: string` was added to `OnboardOptions`, and docs suggest `openclaw onboard --io-intelligence-api-key ...`, but there doesn’t appear to be any code that reads this option to persist credentials or apply config (search only finds the type field). As-is, the flag likely won’t work in non-interactive mode.

Repro: `openclaw onboard --non-interactive --auth-choice io-intelligence-api-key --io-intelligence-api-key <key>` (or just `--io-intelligence-api-key`) will not result in `io-intelligence:default` auth profile being written unless the user also passes `--token/--token-provider`.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
