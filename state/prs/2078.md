## Description

## Problem

The `isContextOverflowError` check was too broad — it matched any text containing 'context overflow', including legitimate conversation discussing the topic.

This caused the `sanitizeUserFacingText` function to replace normal agent responses with error messages when the agent was discussing context overflow as a topic (e.g., debugging the compaction system).

## Root Cause

Line 23 in `errors.ts`:
```typescript
lower.includes("context overflow")
```

This matches any text containing the phrase, not just actual error messages.

## Fix

Changed to require `'context overflow:'` (with colon) to only match actual error messages like:
- `"Context overflow: Summarization failed"`
- `"Context overflow: prompt too large..."`

Normal conversation like "Let's investigate the context overflow bug" will no longer trigger false positives.

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- Added new test case to verify normal conversation text doesn't trigger false positives
