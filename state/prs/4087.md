## Description

## Summary

- Added 29 pre-rendered PNG diagram images across the documentation
- Removed inline `<details>` + Mermaid source blocks from 25 doc files (817 lines removed)
- Fixed README.md image paths to use absolute URLs so diagrams render on GitHub

## Details

The docs previously contained Mermaid source blocks wrapped in `<details>` tags alongside `![alt](/images/diagrams/...)` image references. This PR removes the Mermaid source blocks, keeping only the pre-rendered PNG images for faster page loads and consistent rendering across all platforms.

## Files changed (25)

**docs/ (24 files):** agent-loop, agent-workspace, architecture, broadcast-groups, channel-routing, compaction, cron-jobs, gateway (index, protocol, security), getting-started, install, memory, messages, model-failover, multi-agent, pairing, plugin, queue, session, streaming, tools (index, browser), webhook

**README.md** — hero banner and architecture diagram paths updated to absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs

## Test plan

- [ ] Verify docs site renders diagram images correctly on Mintlify
- [ ] Verify README images render on GitHub
- [ ] Confirm no `mermaid` code blocks remain: `grep -r '```mermaid' docs/ README.md` returns 0 results

Mermaid diagrams are much easier to update and replace, diff, and ingest w/automation than static images. 
That's worth the extra page load time, imo.
