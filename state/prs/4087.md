## Description

## Summary

- Added 29 pre-rendered PNG diagram images across the documentation
- Removed inline `<details>` + Mermaid source blocks from 25 doc files (817 lines removed)
- Fixed README.md image paths to use absolute URLs so diagrams render on GitHub

## Details

The docs previously contained Mermaid source blocks wrapped in `<details>` tags alongside `![alt](/images/diagrams/...)` image references. This PR removes the Mermaid source blocks, keeping only the pre-rendered PNG images for faster page loads and consistent rendering across all platforms.

## Files changed (25)

**docs/ (24 files):** agent-loop, agent-workspace, architecture, broadcast-groups, channel-routing, compaction, cron-jobs, gateway (index, protocol, security), getting-started, install, memory, messages, model-failover, multi-agent, pairing, plugin, queue, session, streaming, tools (index, browser), webhook

**README.md** — hero banner and architecture diagram paths updated to absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs

## Test plan

- [ ] Verify docs site renders diagram images correctly on Mintlify
- [ ] Verify README images render on GitHub
- [ ] Confirm no `mermaid` code blocks remain: `grep -r '```mermaid' docs/ README.md` returns 0 results

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR removes inline Mermaid `<details>` source blocks from the docs and replaces them with pre-rendered PNG diagrams under `docs/images/diagrams/`, leaving Markdown image embeds in the docs pages. It also updates the README hero/architecture images to absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs so they render on GitHub.

Main issue spotted: the README URLs currently point at the PR author’s fork (`davendra/moltbot`) rather than this repository, which makes README rendering depend on an external repo and may break in the future.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe doc-only changes, but README image links likely to break due to pointing at a fork.
- Changes are documentation and image assets only, with no runtime impact. However, the README now depends on images hosted in a contributor fork (`raw.githubusercontent.com/davendra/...`), which is an availability/maintainability risk and should be corrected before merge.
- README.md (image URL targets)

### @logikal (2026-01-29)

Mermaid diagrams are much easier to update and replace, diff, and ingest w/automation than static images. 
That's worth the extra page load time, imo.

**`README.md`**
[P0] README architecture diagram URL also points to fork

Same issue as the hero banner: this image is loaded from `raw.githubusercontent.com/davendra/...` rather than this repository. This makes the README dependent on a third-party fork and can regress rendering later. Prefer `raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/<sha>/docs/images/diagrams/27-readme-architecture.png` (or a repo-relative path if it renders on GitHub).
