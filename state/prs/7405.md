## Description

The Telegram probe currently fails immediately on startup if DNS/network isn't fully ready. This adds a simple retry loop (3 attempts, 1s delay) to `getMe` to handle transient startup races.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a small retry loop around the Telegram `getMe` health probe call so transient startup DNS/network issues don’t cause immediate probe failure. The probe now attempts `getMe` up to 3 times with a 1s delay between failures, then proceeds to parse the response and optionally fetch webhook info as before.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with low risk; changes are localized and straightforward.
- Only modifies the Telegram probe to add a bounded retry loop; no external interfaces change. Main concern is minor typing/maintainability (use of `any`).
- src/telegram/probe.ts
