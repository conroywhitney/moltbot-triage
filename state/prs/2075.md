## Description

## Summary
- Add unauthenticated `/healthz` and `/health` HTTP endpoints for load balancer probes
- Add Cloudflare Tunnel documentation as an alternative to Tailscale
- Add health check endpoint documentation

## Details
The health check endpoints:
- Return `{"status":"ok"}` with HTTP 200 when the gateway is running
- Do **not** require authentication (safe for external probes)
- Set `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store` to prevent caching
- Are intentionally minimal to avoid information disclosure

## Test plan
- [x] Added e2e tests for HTTP health check endpoints
- [x] Lint passes
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Pre-review completed with no issues above 70 confidence threshold

Closes #1971
