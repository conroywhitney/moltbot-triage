## Description

## Summary

- Fixes native Telegram commands (slash menu like `/reset`) delivering confirmations through the wrong Telegram bot account in multi-account setups

## Problem

When using multiple Telegram bot accounts, native commands (e.g., `/reset` from the slash command menu) would send their confirmations through the default Telegram bot instead of the account-specific bot that received the command.

The root cause: `AccountId` was not included in the context payload built by `registerTelegramNativeCommands`, so when `handleCommands` called `routeReply` with `params.ctx.AccountId`, it was `undefined`, causing the delivery system to fall back to the default account.

## Solution

Added `AccountId: route.accountId` to the context payload in `bot-native-commands.ts`, following the established pattern used in:
- Regular Telegram message handling (`bot-message-context.ts`)
- Discord native commands
- Slack slash commands
- LINE, Matrix, and other channel implementations

## Test plan

- [ ] Configure multiple Telegram bot accounts with bindings
- [ ] Send `/reset` command via slash menu from a non-default account
- [ ] Verify the confirmation message is delivered through the same bot that received the command

Closes #2038
