## Description

## Summary

- Add proper E.164 phone number validation to Signal account prompt during onboarding
- Normalize the account value before storing to ensure consistent format

## Problem

The Signal account number prompt only validated that *some* text was entered:

```typescript
validate: (value) => (value?.trim() ? undefined : "Required"),
```

This allowed invalid values like `"ok"` to be stored if a user typed it thinking they were confirming a prompt. The Signal channel would then fail with confusing errors since `"ok"` isn't a valid phone number.

## Solution

Use the existing `normalizeE164` utility to validate the input is a proper E.164 phone number, and provide a helpful error message:

```
Invalid E.164 phone number (must start with + and country code, e.g. +15555550123)
```

Also normalize the stored value to ensure consistent format.

## Test plan

- [ ] Run `clawdbot configure` and select Signal channel
- [ ] Try entering invalid values like "ok", "test", "12345" - should show validation error
- [ ] Enter valid E.164 number like "+15555550123" - should be accepted
- [ ] Verify stored value in `clawdbot.json` is properly formatted
