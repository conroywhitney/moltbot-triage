## Description

Closes #4013
## Summary
Adds missing unit tests for `src/infra/backoff.ts` to verify exponential backoff calculations and abortable sleep behavior.
## Changes
- **src/infra/backoff.test.ts**: New test file covering `computeBackoff` and `sleepWithAbort`.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds unit coverage for the backoff utilities by introducing `src/infra/backoff.test.ts`, validating exponential growth, max capping, jitter bounds, and `sleepWithAbort` resolve/abort behavior. Also extends the existing unhandled rejection tests with a regression case for Node/undici `TypeError("fetch failed")` when the underlying `cause` is missing or has an unknown code, matching the updated fallback logic in `isTransientNetworkError`.

Overall this fits into the `src/infra` layer by strengthening the safety net around retry timing and the gateway’s “don’t crash on transient network issues” behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; changes are tests and a small tweak to transient error classification.
- No obvious functional regressions in the updated `fetch failed` handling, and the new tests exercise the intended behavior. Main concern is test reliability: one jitter test is probabilistic and the fake-timers test doesn’t guarantee cleanup on failure.
- src/infra/backoff.test.ts (test determinism and timer cleanup)

**`src/infra/backoff.test.ts`**
[P2] Jitter test is probabilistic/flaky

This test relies on real `Math.random()` variance (`results.size > 1` over 50 trials). It can still fail if `Math.random()` is stubbed/seeded elsewhere or returns the same rounded value repeatedly. Consider stubbing `Math.random()` to a couple fixed values and asserting exact outputs to keep it deterministic.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
