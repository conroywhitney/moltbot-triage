## Description

Moonshot API only supports `system`, `user`, `assistant` roles.

[Docs](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat): "The role can only be one of system, user, assistant"

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR extends `normalizeModelCompat` to also apply the existing “no developer role” compatibility override to Moonshot models (in addition to z.ai), since Moonshot’s chat API only supports `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles. It also adds a unit test to ensure Moonshot models are normalized with `supportsDeveloperRole: false` when no compat is set.

The change fits into the existing provider compatibility layer in `src/agents/model-compat.ts`, which conditionally adjusts `Model<Api>.compat` for providers that use the OpenAI-compatible API but have role restrictions.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; it’s a small, well-scoped compatibility tweak with test coverage.
- The code change is minimal and covered by a new test; the main risk is mis-detecting Moonshot via a broad `baseUrl.includes` check and the function’s in-place mutation of the `model` object, which can have side effects depending on caller expectations.
- src/agents/model-compat.ts
