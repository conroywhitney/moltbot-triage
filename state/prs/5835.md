## Description

## Summary

Fixes #4954 - `GatewayClient.request()` has no timeout (CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)

- Add 30-second default timeout with `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` pattern
- Add optional `timeoutMs` parameter for caller customization
- Wrap `ws.send()` in try/catch to handle race condition (socket closes between readyState check and send)
- Clear timeout and pending map entry on all exit paths

## Attack Vector Mitigated

Without timeout, if the gateway never responds, the Promise hangs forever, accumulating pending requests and eventually exhausting memory.

## Implementation Pattern

References the correct implementation in `src/imessage/client.ts:127-163` as mentioned in the issue.

## Race Condition Fix

The `ws.send()` can fail even after `readyState === OPEN` check due to timing. Without try/catch:
1. Timeout and pending entry are created
2. `ws.send()` throws
3. Caller gets exception but timeout is still running
4. Timeout fires later causing unhandled rejection + pending map leak

With try/catch: cleanup happens immediately on send failure.

## Test Plan

- [ ] Existing gateway tests pass
- [ ] Manual test: Normal requests work with default timeout
- [ ] Manual test: Request with custom `timeoutMs` respects the value
- [ ] Manual test: Timeout error message includes method name for debugging

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `GatewayClient.request()` (`src/gateway/client.ts`) to add a default 30s timeout and a caller-configurable `timeoutMs`, and ensures pending requests/timeouts are cleaned up on resolution, rejection, and `ws.send()` failures. This addresses the reported resource-leak behavior where requests could hang indefinitely and accumulate in the `pending` map.

The change fits the existing client design by keeping per-request state in `pending` and enforcing completion via a timer, similar to patterns used elsewhere in the repo.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge and meaningfully reduces the risk of hung gateway requests leaking memory.
- The timeout/cleanup logic is straightforward and localized to `GatewayClient.request()`. Main remaining concerns are runtime semantics (Node timers keeping the event loop alive via referenced timeouts) and edge-case `timeoutMs` inputs, which are easy to adjust if desired.
- src/gateway/client.ts (timer lifecycle / unref behavior, timeoutMs edge cases)

## Comments

### @hclsys (2026-02-01)

Thanks for the review!

**P3 (validate timeoutMs)**: ✅ Fixed - added validation to reject `NaN`, `<=0`, and non-finite values, falling back to 30s default.

**P1 (unref)**: The `GatewayClient` maintains an active WebSocket which already references the event loop. On disconnect, `flushPendingErrors()` clears all pending requests. The `unref()` pattern is more relevant for background/heartbeat timers (like line 358) - here the benefit is minimal since the socket lifecycle governs process exit anyway.
