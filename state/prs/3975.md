## Description

## Summary

The TUI's `CombinedAutocompleteProvider` from pi-tui already supports `@path` fuzzy file search via the `fd` binary, but this feature was never enabled because `fdPath` wasn't being passed to the provider.

## Changes

- Add `detectFd()` function to locate the `fd` or `fdfind` binary
- Pass `fdPath` as the third parameter to `CombinedAutocompleteProvider`

## Result

Users with `fd` installed now get fuzzy file autocomplete when typing `@` in the TUI input:

```bash
# Install fd
brew install fd        # macOS
apt install fd-find    # Ubuntu/Debian

# Then in TUI, type @ to trigger file picker
```

## Attribution

Inspired by [opencode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)'s file picker UX (MIT License).

## Testing

Tested locally on macOS with fd 10.3.0 — typing `@` in TUI now shows fuzzy file search results from the workspace directory.

## User Story

The motivation for this feature: moving between **casual mobile chat** (Telegram) and **focused terminal work** for deep thinking tasks.

**Use case:** PhD research in Obsidian vault
- Quick questions/check-ins via Telegram on the go
- Switch to TUI for deep work sessions (writing, research)
- Need to quickly reference/include vault files without leaving the flow

The `@path` picker makes this seamless — type `@`, fuzzy-find your note, and it's in context. No manual path typing, no context-switching to file browser.

This is especially valuable for **non-programming knowledge work** where the vault/workspace has hundreds of markdown files (notes, drafts, references) that need to be pulled into conversation contextually.
