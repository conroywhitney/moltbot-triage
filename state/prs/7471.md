## Description

## What

Adds a tmux monitoring section to the coding-agent skill and fixes the wake command.

## Why

When orchestrating coding agents in the background, users and the host agent have no real-time visibility into what the agent is doing. The existing `exec background:true` pattern returns a session ID for polling, but:
- Users can't watch the agent work live
- Output can be truncated when the process exits
- There's no persistent scrollback for post-completion review

tmux sessions solve all of these — the user can attach/detach freely, full scrollback persists, and the tmux skill already documents session management.

## Changes

- **New section: tmux Monitoring** — recommends launching long-running coding agents in named tmux sessions (`agent-<task-slug>`), with cross-reference to the tmux skill for mechanics
- **Fixed wake command**: `openclaw system event` (was `openclaw gateway wake` which doesn't exist)
- **Clarified when to use each pattern**: tmux for monitored/long tasks, bare exec for quick one-shots
- **Completion detection**: wake command as primary, heartbeat tmux checks as safety net

## Notes

This is purely a skill documentation update — no code changes. The tmux skill already has an "Orchestrating Coding Agents" section; this update adds the reverse cross-reference from the coding-agent skill.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Updates the `coding-agent` skill documentation to (1) fix the completion notification command from the non-existent `openclaw gateway wake` to the supported `openclaw system event --mode now`, and (2) add guidance for running long-lived coding agents inside named tmux sessions so users can attach and monitor progress with persistent scrollback.

This fits alongside the existing tmux skill by adding the “reverse” cross-reference: use the coding-agent skill for how to run agents, and the tmux skill for how to manage/inspect the tmux session.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk (docs-only change).
- Changes are limited to documentation and correct a clearly invalid CLI command; main nits are around wording/anchor stability rather than correctness.

**`skills/coding-agent/SKILL.md`**
[P3] This section repeatedly calls `openclaw system event ... --mode now` a “wake command”. Since this PR just removed a non-existent `openclaw ... wake` command, the “wake command” phrasing can mislead readers into searching for a `wake` subcommand. Consider renaming to “manual wake event”/“system event” wording and/or adding a one-liner like “There is no `openclaw ... wake`; use `openclaw system event --mode now` to wake immediately.”
