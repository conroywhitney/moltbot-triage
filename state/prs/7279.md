## Description

## Summary

- Add pattern to `isContextOverflowError()` to recognize the error message `"input length and max_tokens exceed context limit"` returned by claude-max-api and similar proxies
- Without this fix, auto-compaction was not triggering because the error pattern wasn't recognized

## Test plan

- [x] Added test cases for the new error pattern
- [x] All existing tests pass

Fixes #5433

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR expands context-overflow detection in `src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts` by adding a new substring match for errors containing `"exceed context limit"` (a phrasing emitted by claude-max-api and similar proxies when `input + max_tokens` exceeds the model context). A new Vitest case in `src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers.iscontextoverflowerror.test.ts` covers representative samples to ensure auto-compaction triggers for these messages.

The change fits into the existing error-classification layer used by Pi embedded helpers: `isContextOverflowError()` is a fast, conservative predicate that gates compaction/retry and user-facing messaging in `formatAssistantErrorText()` and `sanitizeUserFacingText()`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is narrowly scoped (a single additional substring check) with targeted test coverage, and it only broadens recognition of context overflow errors to trigger existing compaction behavior.
- No files require special attention
