## Description

I managed to setup and use z.ai Chinese usage-based endpoint by setting custom provider:

```
  "models": {
    "mode": "merge",
    "providers": {
      "zhipuai-glm-cn": {
        "baseUrl": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4",
        "apiKey": "xxxxx",
        "api": "openai-completions",
        "models": [
        {
            "id": "glm-4.5-air",
            "name": "ZAI GLM 4.5 AIR",
            "reasoning": false,
            "input": ["text"],
            "cost": { "input": 0, "output": 0, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0 },
            "contextWindow": 128000,
            "maxTokens": 96000
        },
        {
            "id": "glm-4.7",
            "name": "ZAI GLM 4.7",
            "reasoning": false,
            "input": ["text"],
            "cost": { "input": 0, "output": 0, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0 },
            "contextWindow": 128000,
            "maxTokens": 96000
        }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
```

But this is not elegant and intuitive. Open this PR to support them better
