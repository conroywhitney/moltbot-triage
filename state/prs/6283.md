## Description

Add MessageFilter class for content-based message filtering:
- Block patterns (denylist) for spam/noise
- Allow patterns (allowlist) for trigger-only mode
- Hybrid modes with exclude patterns (bypass list)
- Two evaluation modes: block-first or allowlist-first

Use cases:
- DD bots: Trigger-only mode (allow specific patterns)
- Support groups: FAQ/Help mode
- Hybrid: Block spam but allow commands

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new `MessageFilter` utility for the Telegram extension that compiles configurable allow/block/exclude regex patterns and evaluates incoming message text/captions in either "block-first" or "allowlist-first" mode. Also includes small helpers to construct the filter and detect/resolve per-group filter config.

The file is self-contained under `extensions/telegram/src/` and is intended to be called by the Telegram message handling pipeline before forwarding content to an agent.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Generally safe to merge, but has a correctness bug around runtime config updates and a couple of behavior/logging surprises.
- The implementation is straightforward and isolated, but `compilePatterns()` can preserve old compiled regexes after `updateConfig()` changes, leading to incorrect filtering behavior. The other findings are lower severity but would likely confuse operators or callers.
