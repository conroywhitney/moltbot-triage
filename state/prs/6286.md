## Description

Re-submission of ghosted PR #5672. Strips absolute paths from sessionId during state migration.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts legacy state migration to avoid persisting machine-specific absolute paths in session metadata. In `src/infra/state-migrations.ts`, `normalizeSessionEntry` now derives `sessionId` from the basename of a path-like `sessionId` (and strips a `.jsonl` extension), and also drops the legacy `sessionFile` field. A new Vitest case in `src/commands/doctor-state-migrations.test.ts` validates that migrating a legacy sessions store containing absolute `sessionId`/`sessionFile` values produces an extension-less id and removes `sessionFile` in the migrated target store.

Overall, this fits into the existing doctor/state-migrations flow by normalizing legacy session entry shapes before writing to the new per-agent `sessions.json` store.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the sessionId normalization heuristic may miss some legacy formats.
- The change is small and covered by a focused test, but the new “strip only when separators exist” heuristic can under-normalize relative `.jsonl` values and may also transform non-path identifiers that happen to contain separators, depending on what legacy stores contained.
- src/infra/state-migrations.ts (normalizeSessionEntry)
