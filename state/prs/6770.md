## Description

## Summary

- When a device pairs as a node with operator privileges, it can push its own gateway config via `config.patch`, overwriting `gateway.mode` from `"local"` to `"remote"` on the host — which kills the gateway
- This happens because the macOS client's config has `gateway.mode="remote"` (since from its perspective it connects to the gateway remotely), and the config sync pushes that value onto the host's `openclaw.json`
- Adds `stripProtectedGatewayPaths()` to strip `gateway.mode`, `gateway.remote`, `gateway.bind`, and `gateway.port` from `config.patch` payloads before merging — these are inherently host-specific transport fields
- Non-protected gateway fields (e.g. `gateway.auth`) still pass through normally
- Stripped fields are logged as warnings via `logGateway.warn`
- `config.set` (full replace) and direct CLI/file edits can still change these fields

## Reproduction

1. Run gateway locally with `gateway.mode: "local"`
2. Pair a macOS device that has `gateway.mode: "remote"` in its own config
3. The device's config sync pushes `gateway.mode: "remote"` + `gateway.remote: {...}` via `config.patch`
4. Gateway restarts, sees `mode: "remote"`, refuses to start → all channels (Telegram, WhatsApp) go offline

## Test plan

- [x] Unit tests for `stripProtectedGatewayPaths` (13 tests passing)
- [x] E2e test verifying `config.patch` with `gateway.mode`/`gateway.remote` does not alter the stored config
- [x] Verified non-gateway fields in the same patch are still applied correctly
- [x] Verified patches without gateway keys pass through unchanged

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR prevents paired devices from accidentally breaking a host-local gateway by stripping host-specific gateway transport fields (`gateway.mode`, `gateway.remote`, `gateway.bind`, `gateway.port`) out of `config.patch` payloads before applying the JSON merge patch. The change is implemented via a new `stripProtectedGatewayPaths()` helper in `src/config/merge-patch.ts`, integrated into the gateway `config.patch` handler (`src/gateway/server-methods/config.ts`) with warning logs for stripped keys, and covered by new unit tests plus an e2e regression test to ensure non-protected fields in the same patch still apply.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge with minor integration-contract risk around the new `context` dependency in `config.patch`.
- The change is narrowly scoped, covered by unit + e2e tests, and the stripping logic is straightforward. The main risk is a runtime crash if any handler invocation path doesn’t supply `context.logGateway`, since `config.patch` now assumes it exists when logging stripped fields.
