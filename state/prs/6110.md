## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR refactors `formatTerminalLink` in `src/utils.ts` to simplify the `allow` computation for emitting OSC-8 terminal hyperlinks. The nested ternary that treated `opts.force` as a tri-state override is replaced with nullish coalescing, keeping the default behavior of enabling links only when `process.stdout.isTTY` is truthy and allowing explicit `true`/`false` overrides.

Change is localized to a utility function used for terminal output formatting; no broader control flow or API surface changes are introduced.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small refactor in a single utility function that preserves the intended tri-state behavior of `opts.force` (true/false override, otherwise fall back to TTY detection) via `??`. No behavioral change is apparent for valid inputs, and the modification is unlikely to impact unrelated parts of the codebase.
- No files require special attention
