## Description

Update documentation references from legacy paths to the current state directory structure.

## Changes

- `~/.clawdbot/` → `~/.openclaw/`
- `/__moltbot__/canvas/` → `/__openclaw__/canvas/` (matches `CANVAS_HOST_PATH` constant)

## Affected skills

| Skill | Changes |
|-------|---------|
| canvas | Config paths and URL prefix |
| nano-banana-pro | Config path |
| openai-whisper-api | Config path |
| session-logs | Session log paths |
| sherpa-onnx-tts | Tool install paths and config |

## Notes

The canvas URL prefix was already updated in code (`CANVAS_HOST_PATH = "/__openclaw__/canvas"` in `src/canvas-host/a2ui.ts`), but the skill documentation still referenced the old `/__moltbot__/` prefix.
