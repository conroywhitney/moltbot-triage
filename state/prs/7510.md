## Description

Fixes #6760.

## Problem

The `remoteNodes` Map in `skills-remote.ts` caches node metadata when nodes connect but never removes entries when nodes disconnect. In environments with frequent node churn (ephemeral containers, dynamic IPs), this causes unbounded memory growth.

## Fix

Add a cap of 1,000 entries with FIFO eviction (Map insertion order) when a genuinely new node is inserted. Updates to existing nodes reuse their slot without triggering eviction.

The cap is a module-level constant rather than a config option — 1,000 `RemoteNodeRecord` entries is a few KB, well within safe limits, and exposing internal memory tunables in user-facing config adds complexity without clear benefit.

## Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/infra/skills-remote.ts` | Add `MAX_REMOTE_NODES` constant + eviction in `upsertNode()` |
| `src/infra/skills-remote.cache-cap.test.ts` | 2 tests: bulk insertion + upsert behaviour |

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a module-level cap (`MAX_REMOTE_NODES = 1000`) to the `remoteNodes` in-memory cache in `src/infra/skills-remote.ts`, evicting the oldest entry (Map insertion order) on insertion of a genuinely new node when at capacity. This addresses unbounded growth in environments with high remote node churn.

It also adds a Vitest file intended to cover the new behavior, though the current assertions only verify that calls don’t throw and don’t directly validate eviction semantics.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with the main risk being that the added tests don’t effectively guard the new eviction behavior.
- The production change is small and localized (FIFO eviction only on new insertions) and shouldn’t affect existing-node updates, but the accompanying tests are currently too weak to catch regressions, reducing confidence in long-term correctness.
