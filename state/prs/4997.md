## Description

## Summary

Add `model_not_found` to `FailoverReason` type so that 404 errors from deprecated or unavailable models (like Google Gemini 1.5) trigger failover to alternative models instead of hanging indefinitely.

## Problem

When a configured model returns a 404 "not found" error (e.g., deprecated Google Gemini models like `gemini-1.5-pro`), the error was not classified as a failover reason, causing the embedded agent to hang indefinitely instead of falling back to alternative models.

## Solution

- Add `model_not_found` to `FailoverReason` type
- Add `model_not_found` to `AuthProfileFailureReason` type
- Add `modelNotFound` patterns to `ERROR_PATTERNS`:
  - `/\b404\b/`
  - `"not found"`
  - `"model not found"`
  - `"is not found for api version"`
  - `"does not exist"`
  - `"model is not available"`
  - `"is not supported for"`
  - `"not_found"`
- Add `isModelNotFoundErrorMessage()` helper function
- Update `classifyFailoverReason()` to check for model not found errors
- Add 404 status check in `resolveFailoverReasonFromError()`
- Export `isModelNotFoundErrorMessage` from `pi-embedded-helpers`

## Testing

- Added tests for model 404 error classification
- All existing tests pass (10 failover-related tests, 33 auth-profiles tests)

Closes #4992

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new failover classification for “model not found” situations, intended to treat 404 / deprecated-model errors as failover triggers rather than letting embedded agents stall. Concretely, it extends the `FailoverReason` and `AuthProfileFailureReason` unions with `model_not_found`, adds new error-message patterns and an `isModelNotFoundErrorMessage()` helper, wires that into `classifyFailoverReason()` and `resolveFailoverReasonFromError()`, and re-exports the helper from `pi-embedded-helpers`. A focused test was added to ensure common 404/model-not-found strings and a Gemini JSON payload map to `model_not_found`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge; one missing status mapping could cause inconsistent status reporting for the new failover reason.
- Changes are localized to failover classification logic and type unions, with tests added for the new classification. The main concern is that `resolveFailoverStatus` was not updated to include `model_not_found`, which may lead to `undefined` status values when errors are coerced into `FailoverError` without an explicit status code.

**`src/agents/failover-error.ts`**
`resolveFailoverStatus` doesn’t return a status for the newly added `"model_not_found"` reason, so downstream code that relies on `resolveFailoverStatus(reason)` (e.g. `coerceToFailoverError` fallback on `getStatusCode(err) ?? resolveFailoverStatus(reason)`) will produce `undefined` for status even though `resolveFailoverReasonFromError` treats this as an HTTP-404-driven failover case. This can break callers expecting a numeric status for failover responses.

Consider adding a `case "model_not_found": return 404;` here.
