## Description

Running the `docker-setup.sh` on MacOS with Podman.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the local container setup to support Podman as an alternative runtime to Docker. `docker-setup.sh` now auto-detects `docker` vs `podman`, uses the selected runtime for `build` and `compose` commands, and exports host UID/GID into the environment. `docker-compose.yml` sets a `user:` mapping on both gateway and CLI services, aiming to avoid permission issues with bind-mounted volumes (notably on macOS/Podman).

Overall, the changes fit the repo’s container-based dev/onboarding workflow by keeping the same compose topology while swapping out the underlying container CLI based on what’s installed.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, with some compatibility edge cases around Podman Compose detection and unconditional user mapping.
- Changes are small and localized to the container setup scripts/config, but the compose detection logic likely won’t work for common `podman-compose` installs, and the global `user:` mapping may break some environments (e.g., macOS UID 501).
- docker-setup.sh, docker-compose.yml
