<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This change updates the gateway CLI run loop to temporarily register an `unhandledRejection` handler during shutdown, specifically suppressing `AbortError` rejections when a stop/restart signal is received. The goal is to avoid a graceful shutdown being treated as a failure (exit code 1) when cancellations happen as part of teardown.

The new handler is installed when `shuttingDown` is set and is explicitly unregistered after the server close completes (both restart and stop paths).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, with a small risk of leaving a global rejection handler installed on a forced-exit path.
- Change is narrow and follows existing unhandled-rejection-handler patterns, but the shutdown timeout path does not unregister the temporary handler, which could affect long-lived processes/tests if exit isn’t immediate.

## Comments

### @hclsys (2026-02-02)

Addressed: the forced-exit timeout now calls cleanupUnhandledRejectionHandler() before exit, so the temporary AbortError handler is always removed.\n\nTests: pnpm vitest src/cli/gateway.sigterm.test.ts; pnpm format
