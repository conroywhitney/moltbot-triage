## Description

## Summary
Fixes #3469

The TUI's `/model` command was treating `status` and `list` as model names instead of subcommands, resulting in errors like `model not allowed: anthropic/status`.

## Changes
- Added handling for `/model status` - shows current model information
- Added handling for `/model list` - opens the model selector (same as `/models`)

## Test Plan
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes
- [x] `pnpm build` passes  
- [x] `pnpm test` passes (793 test files, 4826 tests)
- [ ] Manual test: run `moltbot tui`, type `/model status` - should show current model info
- [ ] Manual test: run `moltbot tui`, type `/model list` - should open model selector
