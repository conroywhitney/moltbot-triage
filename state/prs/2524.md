## Description

This is a continuation of my #1635 - adds the ability to extend the service account with OAuth to allow for features like reactions. Provides a much better user experience for the `typingIndicator` when set to `reaction`. 

OAuth Setup has two options (docs updated):
- Reuse `gog` auth tokens
- Custom input auth tokens

Showcase:
