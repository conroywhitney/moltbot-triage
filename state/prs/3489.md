## Description

# Chutes AI Provider Integration

This PR ports the **Chutes AI provider integration**, enabling high-performance inference for open-weight models with dynamic discovery and **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** support.

---

## Summary of Changes

### 🤖 Core Integration
- **Dynamic Model Discovery**  
  Implemented `src/agents/chutes-models.ts` to fetch models, pricing, and context windows directly from the Chutes API.
- **TEE Support**  
  Added `confidentialCompute` and `teeOnly` fields to the model configuration types and Zod schemas to support and filter Trusted Execution Environment models.

### 🦞 Onboarding & UX
- **Interactive Flow**  
  Added `chutes-api-key` to the `moltbot onboard` wizard.
- **Preferred Provider Mapping**  
  Mapped the auth choice to the `chutes` provider to ensure the model picker immediately focuses on Chutes models after API key entry.
- **Non-Interactive Support**  
  Added `--chutes-api-key` flag for automated setups.

### 📝 Documentation
- Created `docs/providers/chutes.md` with setup instructions for API keys and OAuth.
- Updated the provider index in `docs/providers/index.md`.

---

## Testing Performed

- [x] **Dynamic Discovery**  
  Verified live fetching of 60+ models from the Chutes API.
- [x] **TEE Filtering**  
  Confirmed that `teeOnly: true` correctly isolates the 21+ available TEE models in the model list.
- [x] **Full Gate**  
  Ran `pnpm lint && pnpm build && pnpm test`. All 192 tests passed.
- [x] **UX Check**  
  Verified the onboarding flow correctly skips the provider filter when a Chutes key is provided.

## Configuration Example

```ts
{
  models: {
    providers: {
      chutes: {
        baseUrl: "https://llm.chutes.ai/v1",
        api: "openai-completions",
        apiKey: "${CHUTES_API_KEY}",
        teeOnly: true // Filter for TEE models
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## AI-Assisted Integration
