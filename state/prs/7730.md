## Description

## Summary

When `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` are not set (SSH sessions, WSL, certain terminals), `systemctl --user` commands fail with:

```
Failed to connect to bus: $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not defined
```

The `isSystemdUserServiceAvailable` function already handled this error gracefully by returning `false`. However, `isSystemdServiceEnabled` was calling `assertSystemdAvailable()` directly, which throws on this error.

This caused the onboarding wizard to show error messages like:

```
Gateway service check failed: Error: systemctl --user unavailable: Failed to connect to bus: $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not defined
```

## Fix

Wrap the `assertSystemdAvailable()` call in `isSystemdServiceEnabled` with try-catch and return `false` when it throws. This is semantically correct — if systemd user services are unavailable, no service can be enabled.

## Testing

Added 3 test cases to `systemd-availability.test.ts`:
- Returns false when DBUS env vars are missing
- Returns true when service is enabled
- Returns false when service is not enabled

All existing tests continue to pass.

Fixes #1818

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR makes `isSystemdServiceEnabled` resilient to environments where `systemctl --user` can’t connect to the user bus (common in SSH/WSL when DBUS env vars aren’t set). The core change wraps `assertSystemdAvailable()` in a try/catch and returns `false` on failure, aligning behavior with `isSystemdUserServiceAvailable()`.

It also adds Vitest coverage for the new behavior, plus basic enabled/disabled cases, to prevent regressions in the onboarding wizard’s systemd checks.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and improves robustness for common non-GUI Linux environments.
- The change is small, localized, and covered by new unit tests. Main remaining concern is that the new catch-all could hide unrelated `assertSystemdAvailable()` failures by silently returning false, which may reduce diagnosability in unexpected error scenarios.
- src/daemon/systemd.ts (catch-all error handling semantics)
