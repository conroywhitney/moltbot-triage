## Description

## Summary
Adds support for creating posts in Discord forum channels (type 15).

## Problem
The `message` tool's `thread-create` action didn't support Discord forum channels. Forum channels require a `message` object when creating threads, which wasn't being passed, resulting in "This field is required" errors.

## Solution
- Added `message` parameter to `DiscordThreadCreate` type
- Updated `createThreadDiscord` to handle forum posts with message body
- Modified `thread-create` action to accept and pass message parameter
- Forum posts now use the correct endpoint: `/channels/{channelId}/threads`

## Usage
```javascript
message({
  action: "thread-create",
  channelId: "<forum_channel_id>",
  threadName: "Post Title",
  message: "Post content"
})
```

## Testing
Tested successfully creating forum posts in a Discord forum channel (type 15).

## Files Changed
- `src/discord/send.types.ts` - Added `message` parameter to type definition
- `src/discord/send.messages.ts` - Updated thread creation logic for forum posts
- `src/agents/tools/discord-actions-messaging.ts` - Added message extraction
- `src/channels/plugins/actions/discord/handle-action.ts` - Added message parameter mapping
