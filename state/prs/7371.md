## Description

Adds a simple dropdown filter to the Skills dashboard for filtering by install status (All/Installed/Not installed).

- Filters based on whether required bins are missing
- Minimal diff - reuses existing filter pattern
- Clean UI integration matching existing dashboard design

## AI-Assisted PR

- [x] Built with Codex
- [x] Lightly tested - manually verified filter logic, UI rendering looks correct
- [x] Understand the code - adds state for installFilter, wires through app.ts and app-render.ts, implements filtering in skills.ts view based on skill.missing.bins.length

**Prompt:**
```
Add a filter to the OpenClaw dashboard UI skills list that allows filtering by installed/not installed status.

Requirements:
- Minimal diff - reuse existing patterns in the codebase
- Follow repo conventions for code style and structure
- Locate the skills list UI component
- Add a simple filter control (dropdown or toggle buttons)
- Filter the displayed skills based on installation status
- Keep the UI clean and consistent with existing dashboard design
```
