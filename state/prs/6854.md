## Description

## Summary

Fix [CWE-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) vulnerability in `src/auto-reply/reply/abort.ts`.

**Problem**: `ABORT_MEMORY` Map has no cleanup mechanism - entries accumulate indefinitely causing memory leak
**Impact**: OOM crash on long-running servers
**Fix**: Add size limit (10k entries) + delete entry on `setAbortMemory(key, false)` instead of storing `false`

## Changes

- `src/auto-reply/reply/abort.ts`: Add `MAX_ABORT_ENTRIES` constant and modify `setAbortMemory()` to:
  - Delete entry when value is `false` (wires into existing cleanup path in `body.ts:40`)
  - Evict oldest entry (FIFO) when map reaches 10k entries

## Testing

- [x] `pnpm format` passes
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- [x] `pnpm test` passes (804 test files, 4969 tests)

## References

- Fixes #6629
- CWE: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR mitigates unbounded growth of the in-memory `ABORT_MEMORY` map used for fast abort handling by introducing a maximum entry count (10k) and treating `setAbortMemory(key, false)` as a delete rather than storing `false`. When the cap is reached, the oldest entry is evicted (FIFO), leveraging `Map` insertion order.

The change is localized to `src/auto-reply/reply/abort.ts` and affects how abort state is remembered/cleared during message handling and session cleanup flows.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Change is small, localized, and uses standard Map semantics (deleting on false; FIFO eviction based on insertion order). No external interfaces changed, and the PR reports passing formatting, lint, and test suites.
- No files require special attention

Nice fix — the delete-on-false approach is cleaner than storing a false value, good call. FWIW I noticed the same unbounded-collection pattern across several modules (#6758, #6760, #6733) and used a similar FIFO eviction approach. One thing worth considering: the `while` loop for eviction could be simplified to a single `if` since `setAbortMemory` only ever adds one entry at a time.
