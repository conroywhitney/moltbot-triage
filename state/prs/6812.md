## Description

### Summary

 Fixes an issue where the Channels page title/header could be partially hidden/overlapped under
 the topbar, especially on smaller-height viewports.

 ### Root cause

 The shell layout used a fixed topbar row height + fixed topbar height, which could force the
 content area to compress and visually overlap/clamp the content header.

 ### Changes

 - Make the shell’s topbar row height flexible (grid-template-rows: auto 1fr).
 - Use min-height for .topbar instead of a hard height so it can grow when needed.
 - Prevent .content-header from shrinking (flex-shrink: 0).
 - Add small-height viewport adjustments (@media (max-height: 720px)) to keep header spacing and
 typography readable.

### Screenshots (Before / After)

**Repro environment:** macOS, Chrome 144, viewport ~1480×950 (or smaller-height windows).

 ### Testing

 - npm run ui:dev
 - Verify /channels header/title is fully visible (incl. small-height window).
 - Quick sanity on /instances and other tabs (no regressions for all flows).

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts the UI shell layout to prevent page headers/titles from being overlapped by the topbar on short viewports. It makes the shell’s topbar grid row flexible (`grid-template-rows: auto 1fr`), allows the topbar to grow via `min-height` instead of a fixed height, prevents the `.content-header` flex item from shrinking, and adds a `@media (max-height: 720px)` block to reduce content padding and title/subtitle sizing on short screens.

These changes live in `ui/src/styles/layout.css` and affect the shared shell/topbar/content layout used across pages (e.g., Channels, Instances), so they should improve overall layout robustness on small-height windows without requiring component-level changes.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is limited to CSS layout adjustments in a single stylesheet, uses standard grid/flex properties, and is targeted at fixing header overlap on short viewports. No functional logic changes or risky side effects were found in the diff.
- No files require special attention
