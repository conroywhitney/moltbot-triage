## Description

AI-assisted: yes

  Reason:
  Setting up Clawdbot for a friend, he got hung up at this step, and it was hard to find on Discord's website.

  Change:
  Adds the direct Discord Developer Portal new application URL to the CLI onboarding hint.

  Testing:
  - pnpm lint
  - pnpm build
  - pnpm test (repo has unrelated browser test failures)
