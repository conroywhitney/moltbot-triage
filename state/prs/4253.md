<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the unhandled rejection/transient-network classification to also treat stringified/wrapped `fetch failed` errors (e.g., `"TypeError: fetch failed"`) as transient, preventing the gateway from exiting on those unhandled rejections. It also adds a Vitest unit test covering the wrapped message case. The change fits into the existing `src/infra/unhandled-rejections.ts` policy layer that decides which unhandled rejections should be suppressed vs treated as fatal/config errors.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, with a small risk of over-classifying unrelated errors as transient based on message matching.
- Changes are localized to transient-network detection and are covered by an added unit test; the main concern is the broadened substring match (`includes("fetch failed")`) which could suppress some non-network failures if their messages contain that phrase.
