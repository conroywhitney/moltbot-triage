## Description

## Summary
Fixes #6877

The default pre-compaction memory flush prompt doesn't instruct agents to preserve existing file content. This causes agents to overwrite memory files with only the current session's content.

## Changes
- Updated `DEFAULT_MEMORY_FLUSH_PROMPT` to explicitly instruct agents to read existing files first and append new content

## Testing
- Manual testing with agent running pre-compaction flushes
- Verified agent now reads existing file before writing

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the default pre-compaction memory flush prompt so agents are explicitly instructed to **read an existing `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` file and append**, rather than overwriting prior entries.

The change is localized to the auto-reply memory flush settings (`src/auto-reply/reply/memory-flush.ts`), affecting the guidance given to agents during the memory-flush turn. There’s also a newly added `openclaw-2026-02-02.log` file that appears to be a local runtime artifact.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; it’s a small prompt-only behavior change with minor cleanup needed.
- Core functional change is a prompt string update and is unlikely to break runtime behavior. Main concerns are repo hygiene (a committed log file) and minor formatting churn in the modified prompt block.
- openclaw-2026-02-02.log (should likely be removed from the PR); src/auto-reply/reply/memory-flush.ts (formatting/indentation)
