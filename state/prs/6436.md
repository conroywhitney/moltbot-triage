<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds new provider documentation at `docs/providers/mistral.md` covering Mistral account setup, API key creation, onboarding CLI usage, configuration snippets, a short model list, and troubleshooting notes. This follows the existing provider-docs pattern (frontmatter + setup steps + config examples) to help users successfully authenticate and select a Mistral model in OpenClaw.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; main risk is minor doc inconsistency that could cause copy/paste configuration errors.
- Changes are isolated to a new documentation file with no runtime impact. The only actionable issues found are consistency/clarity problems around how model IDs are referenced, which could confuse users but won’t affect code execution.
- docs/providers/mistral.md
