## Description

Updates the coding-agent skill documentation to explicitly recommend using Sub-Agents (sessions_spawn) for execution. This prevents blocking the main agent loop during long-running coding tasks. Also clarifies the internal usage of bash with pty:true within the sub-agent.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `skills/coding-agent/SKILL.md` to recommend a non-blocking execution model where the main agent orchestrates work by spawning sub-agents (`sessions_spawn`) and those sub-agents run interactive coding CLIs via `bash` with `pty:true`. It reframes the doc from “bash-first” to an explicit orchestration/execution split and adds a concrete `sessions_spawn` example alongside the existing PTY guidance for running Codex/Claude Code/Pi.


<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s a documentation-only change with minor consistency risks.
- Changes are confined to a single markdown doc and don’t affect runtime behavior. The main risk is documentation correctness/usability (e.g., headings/anchors and copy-pastable examples).
