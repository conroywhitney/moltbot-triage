## Description

## Summary

This PR addresses a security vulnerability where internal error details could leak to HTTP clients through the OpenAI-compatible API endpoints.

## Problem

The `openai-http.ts` and `openresponses-http.ts` files use `String(err)` to return error messages directly to clients. This can expose:
- Stack traces
- File paths
- Internal error details

This is the same class of vulnerability that was fixed in #2387 for `server-http.ts`.

## Solution

Replace `String(err)` with safe error messages:
- **500 errors (api_error)**: Return generic `"Internal server error"`
- **400 errors (invalid_request_error)**: Return `err.message` only (no stack trace), with fallback to `"Invalid request"`

## Changes

- `src/gateway/openai-http.ts`: 2 locations fixed
- `src/gateway/openresponses-http.ts`: 4 locations fixed

## Testing

- [x] Build passes
- [x] Changes are minimal and focused

## AI Disclosure

This PR was AI-assisted (Claude). The issue was discovered through code pattern analysis similar to #2387.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the OpenAI-compatible HTTP handlers (`src/gateway/openai-http.ts` and `src/gateway/openresponses-http.ts`) to avoid sending `String(err)` back to clients. In non-streaming paths it now returns a generic 500 `api_error` message ("Internal server error"), and in several request-validation paths it returns `err.message` (with a fallback) for 400 `invalid_request_error responses. This aligns these gateway endpoints with the earlier hardening done for the server HTTP handler to reduce accidental leakage of stack traces/paths/internal error details.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and improves security, with a small remaining risk of leaking internal details via `err.message` in 400 responses.
- Changes are localized and reduce error-detail exposure for 500s. The main caveat is that `err.message` is still returned for some 400 paths, and those messages can include internal implementation details depending on what throws; this is a security-hardening consistency concern rather than a functional correctness risk.
