## Description

## Summary

This PR addresses a security vulnerability where internal error details could leak to HTTP clients through the OpenAI-compatible API endpoints.

## Problem

The `openai-http.ts` and `openresponses-http.ts` files use `String(err)` to return error messages directly to clients. This can expose:
- Stack traces
- File paths
- Internal error details

This is the same class of vulnerability that was fixed in #2387 for `server-http.ts`.

## Solution

Replace `String(err)` with safe error messages:
- **500 errors (api_error)**: Return generic `"Internal server error"`
- **400 errors (invalid_request_error)**: Return `err.message` only (no stack trace), with fallback to `"Invalid request"`

## Changes

- `src/gateway/openai-http.ts`: 2 locations fixed
- `src/gateway/openresponses-http.ts`: 4 locations fixed

## Testing

- [x] Build passes
- [x] Changes are minimal and focused

## AI Disclosure

This PR was AI-assisted (Claude). The issue was discovered through code pattern analysis similar to #2387.
