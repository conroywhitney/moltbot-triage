## Description

Bug Description

When sending to a Signal group via the message tool, the base64-encoded group ID is lowercased before being passed to signal-cli. This breaks the ID since base64 is case-sensitive.

removed the toLowerCase methode from the whole id and kept it for the prefix only

closes #4537
