## Description

Bug Description

When sending to a Signal group via the message tool, the base64-encoded group ID is lowercased before being passed to signal-cli. This breaks the ID since base64 is case-sensitive.

removed the toLowerCase methode from the whole id and kept it for the prefix only

closes #4537

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates Signal target normalization so `group:<base64>` IDs are no longer forced to lowercase before being passed to `signal-cli`, preserving case sensitivity for base64 group IDs.

Change is localized to `normalizeSignalMessagingTarget` in `src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.ts`, altering only the `group:` branch output; other target forms (`username:`, `uuid:`, bare phone numbers) remain lowercased as before.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and addresses a real case-sensitivity bug, with a small chance of prefix-format regressions.
- The change is minimal and scoped to the `group:` normalization path, which correctly avoids lowercasing a base64 payload. Main remaining concern is whether callers rely on the normalized output always having a canonical lowercase `group:` prefix even when the input prefix is mixed-case.
