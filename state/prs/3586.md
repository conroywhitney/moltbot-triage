## Description

## Summary

- OpenAI provider had `transcribeAudio` method but didn't declare `"audio"` in its capabilities array

## Changes

- Added `"audio"` to OpenAI provider's capabilities
- Updated test mock to reflect the fix
- Added new test to validate providers declare capabilities matching their implemented methods

Fixes #3539
