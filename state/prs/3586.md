## Description

## Summary

- OpenAI provider had `transcribeAudio` method but didn't declare `"audio"` in its capabilities array
- This caused audio transcription to fail for Telegram voice messages when using OpenAI

## Changes

- Added `"audio"` to OpenAI provider's capabilities
- Updated test mock to reflect the fix
- Added new test to validate providers declare capabilities matching their implemented methods

Fixes #3539

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes OpenAI audio transcription selection by adding the missing `"audio"` capability to the OpenAI media-understanding provider, updates the `resolveModelEntries` test fixture accordingly, and introduces a registry-level invariant test to ensure providers’ declared capabilities match the methods they implement.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge and should fix OpenAI audio transcription selection with low behavioral risk.
- Change is small and localized (capability list + test updates). Main residual risk is test fragility/churn from redundant provider-specific assertions; no runtime logic changes beyond capability exposure.
- src/media-understanding/providers/providers.test.ts
