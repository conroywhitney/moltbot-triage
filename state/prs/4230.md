## Description

Introduces a comprehensive event bus for cross-channel coordination, async workflows, and plugin communication.

Components:
- Core event bus with topic-based pub/sub routing
- Wildcard pattern matching (*, #) for flexible subscriptions
- SQLite persistence layer for event replay and auditing
- Gateway integration bridging existing agent/diagnostic events
- Plugin API for event subscription and emission
- Typed event catalog with 20+ system events

Features:
- Priority-ordered handler execution
- Session and source filtering
- Error isolation (handlers don't crash the bus)
- Async handler support with timeout protection
- Sequence numbering for ordering guarantees
