## Description

## Summary
- Fixes compaction safeguard extension failing when `ctx.model` is undefined
- Stores model in session-scoped runtime registry during extension setup
- Uses runtime model as fallback when ExtensionRunner is not initialized

## Problem
When `compactEmbeddedPiSessionDirect()` is called directly (not through the normal agent flow), the `ExtensionRunner` is never initialized, so `ctx.model` returns undefined. This causes the compaction safeguard extension to skip summarization entirely.

## Solution
Leverages the existing `CompactionSafeguardRuntimeValue` registry pattern:
1. Store the model alongside `maxHistoryShare` when building extension paths
2. In the extension, check `ctx.model ?? runtime?.model` to use the fallback
3. Add warning log when both sources are unavailable

## Test plan
- [x] Type check: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` (no errors)
- [x] Lint: `npx oxlint --type-aware` (0 errors)
- [x] Tests: `npx vitest run src/agents/` (1062 tests passed)

Fixes #4121

Supersedes #4161 (rebased cleanly from main with single commit)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR addresses a compaction safeguard edge case where `compactEmbeddedPiSessionDirect()` can run without an initialized `ExtensionRunner`, leaving `ctx.model` undefined and causing summarization to be skipped.

Changes include:
- Persisting the selected model into the existing session-scoped `CompactionSafeguardRuntimeValue` registry during embedded extension setup (`src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/extensions.ts`).
- Extending the runtime value type to include an optional `model` reference (`src/agents/pi-extensions/compaction-safeguard-runtime.ts`).
- Updating the compaction safeguard extension to prefer `ctx.model` but fall back to `runtime.model`, and emitting a warning when neither source is available (`src/agents/pi-extensions/compaction-safeguard.ts`).

Overall this fits the established “runtime registry keyed by sessionManager” pattern already used for other PI extensions (e.g., context-pruning).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR appears safe to merge and addresses the reported edge case without changing the main compaction flow.
- Changes are small, localized, and use an existing session-scoped runtime registry pattern. The fallback is only used when `ctx.model` is missing, and existing behavior (returning a fallback summary) remains in place when no model/api key is available. Main risk is around logging/observability and holding a model reference in session runtime, but functional impact looks low.
