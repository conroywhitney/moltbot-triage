<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR extends the Cron UI to make the jobs list more usable: it adds job status (all/enabled/disabled) and session (all/main/isolated) filters, threads that state through the `OpenClawApp`/`AppViewState` into the cron view, and improves the run history section by showing the selected job’s name and formatting durations with a friendlier unit.

Changes are localized to the UI layer (`ui/src/ui/*`): new state fields in `app.ts`/`app-view-state.ts`, wiring in `app-render.ts`, and rendering logic in `views/cron.ts`, plus a small formatting helper and updated view tests.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; issues are mostly UI correctness/formatting edge cases.
- Core changes are straightforward state plumbing and view filtering, and tests were adjusted. Main concerns are (1) introduced tab characters that may break formatting/lint expectations, and (2) treating missing duration as 0ms can misrepresent run data in some API responses.
- ui/src/ui/views/cron.ts

[P0] Tabs/indentation got introduced into the template

Lines around the conditional `props.form.payloadKind === "agentTurn"` include literal tab characters (visible as `\t` in the diff). This will cause formatting churn and can break lint/format rules, plus makes future diffs noisy.

```suggestion
          ${
            props.form.payloadKind === "agentTurn"
              ? html`
