## Description

- fix docs format: change unquoted object keys to quoted strings in browser config json

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Updates the browser configuration examples in `docs/tools/browser.md` to use valid JSON-style quoted keys (e.g., `"browser"`, `"profiles"`, `"cdpPort"`) rather than unquoted JSON5 keys, improving copy/paste compatibility for users editing `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- Safe to merge; documentation-only change with a small consistency issue in remaining examples.
- Reviewed the sole diff and surrounding context in `docs/tools/browser.md`. The change achieves its stated goal for the main config block, but other json5 examples in the same doc still use unquoted keys, which is inconsistent and may confuse readers; otherwise no functional or security impact.
- docs/tools/browser.md (ensure all config examples follow the same quoted-key convention)

[P2] Inconsistent example format in “Use Brave” section

Earlier the page presents config as `json5` but uses fully quoted JSON keys; later in this section the `json5` snippets still use unquoted keys (`browser`, `executablePath`), which is inconsistent with the stated goal (“change unquoted object keys to quoted strings”) and can confuse users copying examples. Consider updating these later snippets to also quote keys for consistency.

Also appears in the Browserless example at `docs/tools/browser.md:168-182`.
