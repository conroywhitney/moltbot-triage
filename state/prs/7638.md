## Description

Added new skills for Gitea, Forgejo, and Codeberg to the `skills/` directory. Each skill uses the `tea` CLI and provides instructions for installation via brew and go, as well as examples for common tasks like managing issues, pull requests, actions, and using the API.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds three new skills under `skills/` (`gitea`, `forgejo`, `codeberg`) documenting how to use the `tea` CLI to work with issues, pull requests, actions, and the raw API.

Main issue to address before merge: the frontmatter `metadata` sections are written as a JSON-like blob (braces + trailing commas) rather than valid YAML, which will likely break frontmatter parsing and prevent these skills from being registered/loaded. Secondarily, some `tea` command examples appear inconsistent (`pulls`/`issues` vs `pr`/`issue`), which could lead users to copy/paste commands that don’t work depending on the actual `tea` CLI syntax.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is because the skill frontmatter likely won’t parse and the skills may not load.
- All three added SKILL.md files use a JSON-like `metadata` blob with trailing commas inside YAML frontmatter. Most YAML/frontmatter parsers will reject this, which is a functional break for the new feature. The rest of the change is documentation-only and low risk once the frontmatter format is corrected; command example correctness should be verified against `tea`.
