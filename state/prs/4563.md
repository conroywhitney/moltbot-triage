## Description

I'm trying to use xAI Grok 4-1 fast reasoning, which does not support reasoningEffort (model responds with HTTP 400 if you try).

To resolve, used Claude to investigate and found we already have the base infrastructure in place to handle this, so just allowed this to be set via a compat flag, like this:

```
"models": [
  {
    "id": "grok-4-1-fast-reasoning",
    "name": "Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning",
    "reasoning": true,
    "input": ["text"],
    "cost": {
      "input": 0,
      "output": 0,
      "cacheRead": 0,
      "cacheWrite": 0
    },
    "contextWindow": 2000000,
    "maxTokens": 128000,
    "compat": {
      "supportsReasoningEffort": false
    }
  },
```

I've tested this locally and it works.
