## Description

This PR implements a sync-before-refresh mechanism for the google-gemini-cli-auth plugin. It ensures that if the external Gemini CLI refreshes its tokens, Moltbot will pick them up instead of failing with an invalid single-use refresh token. This follows the same pattern as PR #2123 for Anthropic. Fixes #3803.
