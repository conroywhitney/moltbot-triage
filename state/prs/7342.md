## Description

ensuring readability of docker-setup.sh

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR makes a small readability tweak to `docker-setup.sh` (adds a blank line before `upsert_env()`), which is used to build the local Docker image, generate/update a `.env`, optionally write an extra compose file for mounts/volumes, run interactive onboarding via `openclaw-cli`, and then start the gateway container.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The diff is effectively formatting-only, but the review surfaced a pre-existing robustness issue in `docker-setup.sh` that can cause token generation to fail on systems without `openssl` and `python3` under `set -e`.
- docker-setup.sh

**`docker-setup.sh`**
[P1] `python3` fallback isn’t checked, so token generation can fail under `set -e`.

If `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is unset and `openssl` isn’t installed, this script unconditionally runs `python3` (docker-setup.sh:44-48). On hosts without `python3`, the subshell will fail and the script exits. Either require `python3` (like `docker`) or handle the no-openssl/no-python case explicitly so the script can emit a clear error.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
