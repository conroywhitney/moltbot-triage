## Description

Root Cause
The codebase had two separate hook systems that weren't properly connected:

Legacy hooks: api.registerHook() → registry.hooks
Typed hooks: api.on() → registry.typedHooks
The hook runner's hasHooks() and execution logic only checked registry.typedHooks, but the log message counted registry.hooks — creating a misleading situation where hooks appeared registered but never fired.

- types.ts: Added TYPED_HOOK_NAMES export to src\plugins\types.ts
- imported TYPED_HOOK_NAMES into src\plugins\registry.ts and modified `registerHook()` to bridge to `typedHooks `when the event name matches a typed hook like `message_received`
