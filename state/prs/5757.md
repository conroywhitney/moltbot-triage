## Description

## Summary

Replaces a hardcoded developer machine hostname with `localhost` in the local-places skill.

## Changes

- `skills/local-places/src/local_places/main.py`: Changed default `OPENAPI_SERVER_URL` from `http://maxims-macbook-air:8000` to `http://localhost:8000`

## Context

Found while running [Cisco's skill-scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner) against the skills directory. The scanner flagged this as a suspicious URL (HIGH severity), which is technically a false positive for security purposes, but the hardcoded dev hostname should be fixed regardless.

## Testing

- [x] Local verification - grep confirms the change
- The skill's functionality is unchanged; only the default URL is corrected

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the `local-places` FastAPI app’s OpenAPI `servers` default URL from a hardcoded developer hostname to `http://localhost:8000`, while preserving the `OPENAPI_SERVER_URL` environment-variable override (`skills/local-places/src/local_places/main.py`). This reduces false-positive security scanner findings and avoids leaking a developer machine name in generated OpenAPI docs, without changing any request handling logic.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Single-line change to an OpenAPI metadata default; request routing and runtime behavior are unchanged, and the env var override remains intact.
- No files require special attention
