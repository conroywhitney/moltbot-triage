## Description

## Summary
- Fixes #4751
- `normalizeTargetId()` was lowercasing entire target strings including Slack IDs
- Slack IDs are case-sensitive (e.g., `C0ACC8J786L`), so lowercasing breaks API calls
- Now only the prefix (`channel:`/`user:`) is lowercased, ID case is preserved

## Test plan
- [x] Updated existing tests to expect preserved case
- [x] All target-related tests pass
