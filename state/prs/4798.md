## Description

## Summary
- Fixes #4751
- `normalizeTargetId()` was lowercasing entire target strings including Slack IDs
- Slack IDs are case-sensitive (e.g., `C0ACC8J786L`), so lowercasing breaks API calls
- Now only the prefix (`channel:`/`user:`) is lowercased, ID case is preserved

## Test plan
- [x] Updated existing tests to expect preserved case
- [x] All target-related tests pass

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts how messaging target IDs are normalized so that only the target kind prefix (e.g., `user:` / `channel:`) is lowercased while the ID portion preserves its original case. This avoids breaking Slack API calls where IDs are case-sensitive (e.g., `C0ACC8J786L`).

The change is localized to `src/channels/targets.ts` (`normalizeTargetId`) and the corresponding expectations in Slack parsing/normalization tests and directory-config tests were updated to reflect the preserved-case normalized forms.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The behavior change is small and intentionally scoped: only the kind prefix is normalized while preserving ID case to match Slack’s case-sensitive identifiers. Updates are backed by targeted tests and there are no other in-repo call sites that depend on lowercasing the full normalized ID.
- No files require special attention
