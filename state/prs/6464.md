## Description

## Summary
- Adds detection for JSON parse errors to trigger model failover
- Covers OpenAI-style errors ("is not valid JSON")
- Covers Node JSON.parse errors ("Unexpected token")
- Covers truncated JSON errors ("Unexpected end of JSON input")
- Adds test coverage for new error patterns

## Test plan
- [x] Unit tests pass (`pnpm test src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers.classifyfailoverreason.test.ts`)
- [x] Linting passes (`pnpm lint`)
- [x] Formatting passes (`pnpm format`)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR extends the model failover classification logic to treat malformed tool-call JSON parse errors as a `format` failover reason, and adds unit coverage for several common error message variants (OpenAI-style “is not valid JSON”, Node `JSON.parse` “Unexpected token …”, and truncated JSON “Unexpected end of JSON input”). The change plugs a gap where tool-call argument parse failures wouldn’t previously trigger a retry/failover path, improving robustness when models emit malformed tool argument payloads.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with a small risk of over-triggering failover on non-parse errors.
- Change is localized to failover classification and backed by targeted tests, but the new regex is broad enough that it may classify some non-JSON-parse failures as `format`, causing unnecessary failovers in edge cases.
