## Description

Adds a small, non-intrusive status indicator in the Control UI
showing the currently active model.

- Updates live when /model is changed
- Supports cost-tier color coding (high/medium/low)
- Read-only UI change (no routing or protocol changes)
- Helps users confirm model overrides and cost tier at a glance
