## Description

## Summary
The crypto SDK may not have the `requestOwnUserVerification` function, causing a TypeError on startup when E2EE is enabled.

## Problem
When `channels.matrix.encryption: true` is set, the code calls `client.crypto.requestOwnUserVerification()` without checking if the function exists. This causes:
```
{"error":"TypeError: client.crypto.requestOwnUserVerification is not a function"}
```

## Solution
Add a runtime check to verify the function exists before calling it. If not supported, log a debug message instead of throwing.

## Testing
- Tested with E2EE enabled on self-hosted Synapse
- Bot starts without error
- Gracefully handles missing verification support

Fixes #2901

**Note:** The underlying issue is that matrix-bot-sdk doesn't implement device verification. Filed upstream feature request: https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-bot-sdk/issues/82

### @ericmigi (2026-01-30)

I recommend switching to use [mautrixgo](https://github.com/mautrix/go) as the underlying matrix library

brb asking clawd to fork https://github.com/gomuks/gomuks and replace the web frontend with a clawd interface
