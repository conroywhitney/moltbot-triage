## Description

## Summary

Closes #1980

- Add a `<Note>` callout in the Personal Number section explaining that self-chat is expected behavior, not a misconfiguration
- Add FAQ entry directly addressing the common confusion: "Why does Clawdbot reply as me instead of appearing as a separate contact?"
- Link Quick Setup step to the "Getting a phone number" section so users understand the modes upfront

## Test plan

- [ ] Verify Mintlify renders the `<Note>` component correctly
- [ ] Check internal anchor links work (`#getting-a-phone-number-two-modes`, `#dedicated-number-recommended`)
