## Description

Closes **#3945**

## Summary
Connects the `message_sending` and `message_sent` hooks to the outbound message delivery pipeline in `src/infra/outbound/deliver.ts`.

## Changes
- **src/infra/outbound/deliver.ts**:
  - Added `message_sending` hook call before delivery loop.
  - Implemented logic to allow hook to modify content or cancel delivery.
  - Added `message_sent` hook call in `finally` block to track delivery status.
- **src/infra/outbound/deliver.hooks.test.ts**:
  - Added comprehensive test suite verifying hook behavior.

## Verification
- Added new unit tests pass: `src/infra/outbound/deliver.hooks.test.ts`
- Verified no regressions in existing delivery tests: `src/infra/outbound/deliver.test.ts`

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR wires plugin hooks into the outbound delivery pipeline (`src/infra/outbound/deliver.ts`): it runs `message_sending` before sending (allowing mutation/cancellation) and triggers `message_sent` afterward to report success/failure. It also adds a dedicated Vitest suite (`src/infra/outbound/deliver.hooks.test.ts`) covering the basic hook behaviors (no runner, call ordering, mutation, cancellation, and success reporting).

The change fits into the existing outbound flow by wrapping per-payload delivery logic with hook invocations while keeping delivery itself delegated to channel outbound adapters and existing chunking logic.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but there are a couple of behavioral edge cases and a potential test flake to address.
- Hook integration is localized and guarded behind `hasHooks()`, and the tests cover key behaviors; however, cancellations currently bypass `message_sent`, and `message_sent` is fire-and-forget which can make tests nondeterministic. The success calculation is also somewhat brittle because it depends on indirect side effects to `results`.
- src/infra/outbound/deliver.ts, src/infra/outbound/deliver.hooks.test.ts

[P1] `message_sent` hook is skipped when delivery is cancelled by `message_sending`.

If `runMessageSending()` returns `{ cancel: true }`, the code `continue`s before entering the `try/catch/finally`, so `message_sent` never fires for canceled messages. If plugins rely on `message_sent` as a completion signal (e.g., metrics/auditing), cancellations will look like “no event happened”. Consider still emitting `message_sent` with `success: false` (or a distinct flag) when cancellation occurs.

[P1] `message_sent.success` can be reported as false for successful sends via `sendTextChunks`/Signal chunking.

`success` is derived from `results.length > startResultCount`, but `sendTextChunks()` / `sendSignalTextChunks()` push results internally and do not push directly in this `try` block. In those paths, `results.length` can still increase (so this might work), but it’s coupling correctness to implementation detail and can break if those helpers ever change. More importantly, for the `handler.sendPayload()` path you `results.push(...)` directly, but for the chunked paths it’s indirect. Consider using an explicit “didSend” boolean that the send helpers return, or count deltas in a way that’s consistent across all send paths.

[P2] Tests rely on `as any` for plugin registry runtime.

`runtime: {} as any` weakens type safety and can hide required fields for `createPluginRegistry`. If the registry expects specific runtime shape, a minimal typed stub (or helper from existing plugin tests) would make these tests more resilient to refactors.

**`src/infra/outbound/deliver.hooks.test.ts`**
[P2] `message_sent` test may be flaky because the hook is fired fire-and-forget.

In `deliverOutboundPayloads`, `runMessageSent()` is invoked with `void ...` and not awaited, so by the time the test asserts `sentHook` calls, the hook may not have executed yet (depending on event loop timing). Consider awaiting hook completion in production code (or in tests, use `await vi.waitFor(...)` / flush microtasks) so this assertion is deterministic.
