<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the two Twitter profile links in the zh-CN docs landing page (`docs/zh-CN/index.md`) from `twitter.com/...` to `x.com/...` to keep the Chinese documentation consistent with the previously-updated English docs.

The change is localized to the acknowledgements section and does not affect any internal Mintlify routing/anchors or application behavior.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small, localized documentation update (two external links) with no impact on code execution, internal docs routing, or build/test behavior, and the diff matches the stated intent.
- No files require special attention.
