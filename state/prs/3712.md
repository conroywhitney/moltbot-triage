## Description

Audited the web UI for external links and ensured that all links opening in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) explicitly use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. 

### Changes
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links in `ui/src/ui/views/overview.ts`
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links in `ui/src/ui/app-render.ts`

This mitigates "tab-nabbing" vulnerabilities where a malicious page opened in a new tab could maintain a reference to `window.opener` and potentially redirect the original page.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR audits UI links that open in a new tab and adds `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to mitigate tab-nabbing by preventing access to `window.opener`.

One instance in `ui/src/ui/views/overview.ts` still uses `rel="noreferrer"` on a `target="_blank"` link inside the auth hint block, so the mitigation is not consistently applied across all external links.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge, but one remaining external link still lacks `rel="noopener"` and leaves the tab-nabbing vector open for that path.
- Changes are localized to HTML template attributes, but a missed instance (`rel="noreferrer"` without `noopener`) means the intended security mitigation is not fully applied. No broader behavior changes observed.

**`ui/src/ui/views/overview.ts`**
[P1] `target="_blank"` link still uses `rel="noreferrer"` only.

In the first auth hint block, the docs link at `target="_blank"` still has `rel="noreferrer"` (missing `noopener`), so `window.opener` remains available in some browsers and the tab-nabbing mitigation is incomplete for this link.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
