## Description

Audited the web UI for external links and ensured that all links opening in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) explicitly use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. 

### Changes
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links in `ui/src/ui/views/overview.ts`
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links in `ui/src/ui/app-render.ts`

This mitigates "tab-nabbing" vulnerabilities where a malicious page opened in a new tab could maintain a reference to `window.opener` and potentially redirect the original page.
