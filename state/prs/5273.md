## Description

## Summary

Fix broken YAML frontmatter in 3 skills and improve descriptions across 32 skills for better trigger accuracy.

### Structural Fixes
- **canvas**: Add missing YAML frontmatter (had no `---` delimiters at all)
- **discord**: Quote description to fix YAML colon-in-value parse error (`discord tool: send` parsed as nested mapping)
- **food-order**: Quote description to fix same YAML colon-in-value issue (`Triggers: order food`)

These work at runtime due to OpenClaw's dual parser (YAML + line-by-line fallback), but fail any standard YAML parser including the skill-creator's own validator.

### Description Improvements (32 skills)

Expanded short descriptions (<15 words) to 30-40 words with `Use when...` trigger contexts. The `description` field in frontmatter is the primary trigger mechanism — it's how the AI decides when to load a skill. Short descriptions miss activations.

**Before:**
```
description: Get current weather and forecasts (no API key required).
```

**After:**
```
description: Get current weather, detailed forecasts, and conditions for any location using free APIs (wttr.in or Open-Meteo) without API keys or registration. Use when you want to check weather, temperature, rain, forecasts, or what to wear without API setup overhead.
```

### How this was found

Built an automated [skill-evaluator](https://github.com/Terwox/openclaw/tree/fix/skill-frontmatter-and-descriptions) that checks structural quality, frontmatter validity, description length, trigger phrases, credential scanning, and more. Ran it across all 50+ bundled skills.

### Testing
- All 35 modified files pass `yaml.safe_load()` 
- All descriptions are 30+ words with trigger context
- No functional changes — description-only edits + frontmatter quoting

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes broken YAML frontmatter for `canvas`, `discord`, and `food-order`, and expands the `description` frontmatter field across ~32 skills to improve skill-trigger accuracy. These are documentation/frontmatter-only changes; they don’t modify runtime code paths, but they do improve compatibility with standard YAML tooling and validators.


<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; changes are limited to skill documentation/frontmatter.
- Reviewed the diffs across all touched skill markdown files. Changes are confined to YAML frontmatter `description` edits and adding missing delimiters, with no executable code changes. The only issue found is a personal hostname in an example URL inside the Canvas skill doc, which is low-risk but should be sanitized for maintainability/privacy.

**`skills/canvas/SKILL.md`**
[P2] Example URL includes a personal hostname

The example `target:http://peters-mac-studio-1.sheep-coho.ts.net:...` looks like a real/personal device hostname, which conflicts with the repo guideline to keep docs generic (no personal device names/hostnames). Consider replacing it with a placeholder like `your-hostname.ts.net`.

Also, this file already uses `/Users/you/...` placeholders elsewhere, so making this consistent would help.
