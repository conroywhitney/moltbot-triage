## Description

Fixes #2491

## Summary

- Add optional `autoEnter` parameter to the exec tool that auto-appends `Enter` to tmux send-keys commands when missing
- Helps agents reliably execute commands in tmux sessions without forgetting to press Enter
- Default is `false` for safety (opt-in behavior)

## Problem

When agents use the exec tool to send tmux commands, the command gets pasted but Enter isn't automatically pressed. This causes the agent to think commands are "sent" when they're actually waiting for Enter.

## Solution

Added `autoEnter?: boolean` parameter that:
1. Detects when command contains `tmux send-keys` pattern
2. Checks if `Enter` is already at the end
3. If not, appends ` Enter` to the command

## Test plan

- [x] Regular exec commands unchanged when autoEnter is true
- [x] tmux send-keys with Enter unchanged when autoEnter is true
- [x] tmux send-keys without Enter gets Enter appended when autoEnter is true
- [x] Behavior when autoEnter is false or not set (no change)
- [x] Handles `tmux -S socket send-keys` pattern
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Lint passes on modified files
