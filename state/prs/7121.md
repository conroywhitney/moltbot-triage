## Description

Replaced the legacy "CLAWDBOT" text to "OPENCLAW" in the macOS app icon branding.

<img width="921" height="487" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55ec4b92-5a9f-40b0-9ea8-f4d1a9dbc86c" />


The icon containing the old text is being used in the dmg installer and as app icon throughout the system.

Technical Changes:
- Source Asset: Replaced the old `apps/macos/Icon.icon/Assets/openclaw-mac.png` with the updated OpenClaw logo.
- Icon Regeneration: Successfully regenerated the multi-resolution `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/OpenClaw.icns` using the `./scripts/build_icon.sh` script.

AI-assisted: used ai assistance in finding assets (like pngs, icns and scripts file)

Any feedbacks welcome.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the macOS app icon branding by replacing the source PNG asset and regenerating the compiled multi-resolution `.icns` bundle used by the macOS app and DMG packaging. The change lives entirely in static icon assets under `apps/macos/` and does not affect application runtime code paths.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it only updates static macOS icon assets.
- Only binary asset replacements are included (PNG + ICNS) with no code changes, so functional risk is minimal; main remaining risk is purely visual/correctness of the icon output, which appears intentional per PR description.
- apps/macos/Icon.icon/Assets/openclaw-mac.png; apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/OpenClaw.icns

The CI failures are unrelated to this PR. It only updates macOS app icon assets (.png/.icns). The failing tests apprears from pre-existing Telegram media handler issues, not these changes.

Happy to rebase after those are fixed, or merge as it is since they’re unrelated.
