## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR threads a new `usageWebhookUrl` setting through gateway runtime config/state and the HTTP server, then extends the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` handler to (a) report real token usage in responses and (b) POST a `model.usage` webhook payload after each completion (including `gatewayToken`, usage totals, optional cost, and duration). This integrates with existing gateway auth and agent execution by extracting usage from `agentCommand` results and emitting a webhook side-effect when configured.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge, with the main concern being the accuracy/semantics of the new webhook `cost` field and operational behavior of webhook delivery.
- The changes are localized and mostly additive (config plumbing + usage extraction + webhook POST). The main functional risk is that the newly introduced cost computation is hard-coded and likely incorrect for many models/providers, which can mislead downstream consumers; additionally, webhook delivery lacks a timeout, which can cause resource buildup if endpoints hang.
