## Description

## Summary
Fixes #4566 - ARM64 Docker images were incorrectly tagged, causing 'exec format error' when running on ARM64 hosts.

## Root Cause
The docker-release.yml workflow had both `build-amd64` and `build-arm64` jobs pushing tags for BOTH architectures:

```yaml
tags: |
  type=ref,event=branch,suffix=-amd64
  type=ref,event=branch,suffix=-arm64
  # ... (both jobs had both suffixes)
```

This caused whichever build finished last to overwrite the other's tags. Users pulling `main-arm64` images could receive AMD64 binaries, resulting in the exec format error.

## Solution
Each architecture-specific build now only pushes tags matching its platform:

**build-amd64**:
```yaml
tags: |
  type=ref,event=branch,suffix=-amd64
  type=semver,pattern={{version}},suffix=-amd64
```

**build-arm64**:
```yaml
tags: |
  type=ref,event=branch,suffix=-arm64
  type=semver,pattern={{version}},suffix=-arm64
```

The `create-manifest` job continues to create multi-arch manifests with clean tags (no suffix).

## Testing
The fix ensures:
- `main-amd64` tag contains AMD64 image only
- `main-arm64` tag contains ARM64 image only  
- `main` tag is a multi-arch manifest pointing to both

## Changes
- Modified `.github/workflows/docker-release.yml` to fix tag metadata for each arch-specific build job
