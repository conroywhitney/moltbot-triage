## Description

## Summary
> 2nd attempt, [first](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/2648) mistakenly had the schema files committed

When iterating on my local config or trying to quickly validate if an applied config was correct, I find myself generating the full schema and pointing my VSCode at it for autocomplete.

This PR formalizes that process so that others may benefit

- Generate JSON schema + TypeScript types from zod schema for better DX
- Config now accepts `$schema` key without validation errors

## Scripts
- `pnpm schema:gen` - regenerate from zod source

## Usage
```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/moltbot/schemas/moltbot.schema.json",
  "gateway": { ... }
}
```

## Test plan
- [x] `pnpm schema:gen` outputs
- [x] Works with node runtime
- [x] Config schema tests pass
