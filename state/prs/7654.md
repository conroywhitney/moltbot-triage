## Description

## Summary

This PR addresses multiple security issues with a unified defense-in-depth approach:

- **#4949** - DNS rebinding attacks
- **#6609** - Browser bridge authentication  
- **#6606** - Telegram webhook security

## Changes

### Core Security Features

1. **Default zero-trust**: Localhost connections now require token auth by default. The nonce requirement is no longer skipped for local clients.

2. **Explicit opt-in**: Add `gateway.auth.trustLocalhost` config option (default: `false`) for users who need legacy behavior and understand the risks.

3. **Host header validation**: Add `gateway.auth.allowedHosts` config and `validateHostHeader()` function to reject requests with unexpected Host headers, protecting against DNS rebinding attacks even when `trustLocalhost` is enabled.

### Applied To

- **WebSocket connections** (message-handler.ts)
- **All HTTP endpoints** (server-http.ts)
- **Browser control server** (browser/server.ts) - Host validation only
- **Browser bridge server** (browser/bridge-server.ts) - Host validation + allowedHosts param

### New Exports from auth.ts

- `validateHostHeader(req, allowedHosts)` - DNS rebinding protection
- `shouldTrustLocalhost(req, auth, trustedProxies)` - Combined check

## Breaking Change

Local clients that previously connected without tokens will now need to provide authentication. The CLI already sends tokens automatically, so most users won't notice.

## Config Migration

Users who need unauthenticated localhost access can add:
```yaml
gateway:
  auth:
    trustLocalhost: true  # NOT recommended
```

Custom allowed hosts can be added via:
```yaml
gateway:
  auth:
    allowedHosts: ["myhost.local"]
```

## Testing

- 10 new tests added to auth.test.ts (17 total)
- All existing tests pass
- Full test suite: 4998+ tests passing

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR tightens gateway security by introducing a zero-trust stance for localhost and adding Host header validation to mitigate DNS rebinding. Concretely:

- Adds `gateway.auth.trustLocalhost` (default `false`) and `gateway.auth.allowedHosts` config, wiring these into `resolveGatewayAuth()` (`src/gateway/auth.ts`) and the config schema (`src/config/types.gateway.ts`, `src/config/zod-schema.ts`).
- Introduces `validateHostHeader()` and `shouldTrustLocalhost()` helpers in `src/gateway/auth.ts`.
- Enforces Host validation on the main HTTP server (`src/gateway/server-http.ts`), the WebSocket upgrade/connect path (`src/gateway/server/ws-connection/message-handler.ts`), and browser servers (`src/browser/server.ts`, `src/browser/bridge-server.ts`).
- Updates docs to explain DNS rebinding protection and the new localhost trust behavior (`docs/gateway/security/index.md`).

Key things to double-check before merge are test/type consistency around the expanded `ResolvedGatewayAuth` type and whether the `allowedHosts: []` behavior should intentionally disable validation.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is close to safe to merge, but there are a couple of correctness/config-footgun issues to address first.
- Main logic changes are straightforward and consistent across HTTP/WS/browser entry points, but the expanded `ResolvedGatewayAuth` shape appears to break existing test literals, and the Host validation API currently allows a trivial opt-out via an empty allowlist that could defeat the intended security guarantee if misconfigured.
- src/gateway/auth.test.ts; src/gateway/auth.ts

[P0] Tests use outdated `ResolvedGatewayAuth` shape after adding `trustLocalhost`/`allowedHosts`

`ResolvedGatewayAuth` now requires `trustLocalhost` and `allowedHosts` (see `src/gateway/auth.ts:8-15`), but these tests still construct `auth` without those fields (e.g. `src/gateway/auth.test.ts:12`, `:22`, `:29`, etc.). This should be a type error in TS and/or will become a runtime mismatch if the type gets widened later.

Also appears in other test auth literals: `src/gateway/auth.test.ts:22`, `:29`, `:38`, `:47`, `:54`, `:63`, `:72`, `:86`.
