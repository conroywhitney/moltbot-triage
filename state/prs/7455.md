## Description

## Summary
Fixes #7448

Nostr DMs don't work because `subscribeMany` double-wraps the filter array, causing relays to reject with "bad req".

## Problem
The current code uses `pool.subscribeMany()` with the filter wrapped in an array:
```ts
pool.subscribeMany(relays, [{ kinds: [4], "#p": [pk], since }], {...})
```

Since `subscribeMany` already expects an array of filters and internally handles them, this causes a double-wrapped filter to be sent to relays.

## Solution
Use `pool.subscribe()` which takes a single filter object directly:
```ts
pool.subscribe(relays, { kinds: [4], "#p": [pk], since }, {...})
```

## Changes
- `extensions/nostr/src/nostr-bus.ts`: Line 491 - replaced `subscribeMany` with `subscribe` and unwrapped the filter array

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes the Nostr DM subscription in `extensions/nostr/src/nostr-bus.ts` to use `SimplePool.subscribe()` with a single filter object instead of `subscribeMany()` with a filter array. The intent is to avoid accidentally double-wrapping the filters (which can lead to relays rejecting requests with `bad req`) and restore DM delivery.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but depends on the repo’s `nostr-tools` version supporting `SimplePool.subscribe()` with the expected signature.
- The change is small and directly addresses the described filter-shape bug, but it alters the API method used (`subscribeMany` -> `subscribe`), so compatibility with the pinned dependency/version is the main remaining risk.
