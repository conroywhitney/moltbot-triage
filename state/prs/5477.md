## Description

Hi,

I updated the styles for the native MacOS app to follow the system theme colors and are more `Messages.app` alike, I am attaching both light and dark version screenshots of the updated stuff.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the macOS chat UI theme to more closely follow system semantic colors and Messages-like styling. Changes include:

- Adjusted assistant bubble resolved light/dark NSColor values.
- Replaced the previous macOS background stack (materials + gradients) with a semantic system background color.
- Switched the user bubble to `Color.accentColor`.
- Updated composer background/field styles and added a macOS-specific border color based on `separatorColor`.
- Tweaked message bubble border opacities for better definition.

Overall, this fits cleanly into `OpenClawChatTheme` as the centralized styling source, with `ChatMessageViews` consuming those theme values for bubble rendering.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; changes are localized to SwiftUI theming/styling.
- The diff is small and scoped to color/style constants and a single border color tweak. Main risk is visual regression or mismatch with intended macOS semantics in some appearances/accessibility modes, not functional breakage.
- apps/shared/OpenClawKit/Sources/OpenClawChatUI/ChatTheme.swift (background semantic choice); apps/shared/OpenClawKit/Sources/OpenClawChatUI/ChatMessageViews.swift (border color consistency)
