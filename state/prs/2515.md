## Description

## Summary
Adds clear availability notices to platform documentation to address user confusion about missing download links and unavailable pre-built binaries.

## Problem
Issue #1864 and Discord discussions show users are confused when they:
- Click "Download for macOS" and find no binary releases
- Read Android/iOS docs but can't find download links
- Expect publicly available apps that don't exist yet

## Changes
✅ **Android docs** - Added prominent note that pre-built binaries are not yet publicly available  
✅ **iOS docs** - Updated existing notice to match Android format and clarify build-from-source option  
✅ **Platform index** - Added structured breakdown of companion app availability:
- macOS: Available for development builds (build from source)
- iOS/Android: Internal preview; not publicly distributed  
- Windows/Linux: Planned
- Clarified that Gateway + CLI + web interface work fully without companion apps

## Impact
- Reduces confusion for new users trying to download mobile/companion apps
- Sets clear expectations about what's available now vs. planned
- Provides Discord link for users interested in early testing or building from source
- Maintains existing technical documentation while adding crucial context

Fixes #1864
