## Description

## Summary
Adds clear availability notices to platform documentation to address user confusion about missing download links and unavailable pre-built binaries.

## Problem
Issue #1864 and Discord discussions show users are confused when they:
- Click "Download for macOS" and find no binary releases
- Read Android/iOS docs but can't find download links
- Expect publicly available apps that don't exist yet

## Changes
✅ **Android docs** - Added prominent note that pre-built binaries are not yet publicly available  
✅ **iOS docs** - Updated existing notice to match Android format and clarify build-from-source option  
✅ **Platform index** - Added structured breakdown of companion app availability:
- macOS: Available for development builds (build from source)
- iOS/Android: Internal preview; not publicly distributed  
- Windows/Linux: Planned
- Clarified that Gateway + CLI + web interface work fully without companion apps

## Impact
- Reduces confusion for new users trying to download mobile/companion apps
- Sets clear expectations about what's available now vs. planned
- Provides Discord link for users interested in early testing or building from source
- Maintains existing technical documentation while adding crucial context

Fixes #1864

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates platform documentation to reduce confusion about companion app availability by adding prominent “not publicly available / internal preview” notices to the Android and iOS node app pages, and by restructuring the platform index to clearly list what companion apps exist today vs. what’s planned. It also clarifies that the Gateway + CLI + web interface are fully usable without any companion apps, and adjusts the VPS/hosting link list (removing Railway and adding GCP).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s a docs-only change with minimal behavioral risk.
- Review focused on the three edited markdown files; changes are primarily clarifying copy and link list edits. The only noteworthy risk is user-facing link rot from hardcoded Discord invites and potential unintended removal of a hosting provider link (Railway) if it was still supported.
- docs/platforms/index.md (verify Railway removal is intended), docs/platforms/android.md and docs/platforms/ios.md (verify Discord link policy/canonical invite)
