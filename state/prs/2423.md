## Description

Change default bind from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 to prevent unintended network exposure.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR changes the default bind address for the canvas-host HTTP server from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` in `src/canvas-host/server.ts`, reducing the chance of unintentionally exposing the dev/test canvas UI to the local network.

The change is localized to the server startup path (`startCanvasHost`), and continues to respect an explicit `listenHost` override while defaulting to loopback when none is provided.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a one-line default-value adjustment in a single file, aligns with the stated security intent (reduce network exposure), and preserves opt-in behavior via `listenHost` overrides.
- No files require special attention
