## Description

## Motivation

Discovered this bug while running Clawdbot on an Azure VM using **GitHub Copilot with Claude Opus 4.5**. Every message to a WhatsApp group was failing with:

```
400 messages.220: `tool_use` ids were found without `tool_result` blocks immediately after: 
toolu_vrtx_01Hnp1oP5EXSRsPvumoXLJh9, toolu_vrtx_01X49HwBcdSEAMddUbwEUXao. 
Each `tool_use` block must have a corresponding `tool_result` block in the next message.
```

The session had orphaned `tool_use` blocks, and the repair logic wasn't running because GitHub Copilot wasn't recognized as needing Anthropic-style sanitization.

## Root Cause

In `transcript-policy.ts`, `repairToolUseResultPairing` was only enabled for Google or Anthropic providers:
```typescript
const repairToolUseResultPairing = isGoogle || isAnthropic;
```

But `github-copilot` with Claude models uses Anthropic's API format and needs this repair. The provider detection only checked for `provider === "anthropic"` or `modelApi === "anthropic-messages"`, missing Claude models accessed via other providers.

## Solution

Added `isClaudeModel()` helper that detects Claude by checking if `modelId` contains "claude", and wired it into:
- `repairToolUseResultPairing` (fixes the 400 error)
- `validateAnthropicTurns` (Claude needs Anthropic-style turn validation)  
- `allowSyntheticToolResults` (allows inserting synthetic results for missing tool results)

This covers Claude on any provider: github-copilot, openrouter, opencode, amazon-bedrock, etc.

## Testing

Added comprehensive test suite (238 lines) covering:
- Direct Anthropic provider
- Claude via github-copilot, openrouter, opencode, amazon-bedrock
- Non-Claude models (GPT, Llama, Gemini) - correctly NOT enabled
- Edge cases (null/empty/undefined modelId)
- Case-insensitive detection
- google-antigravity Claude models

Logic verified with standalone tests (9/9 passing). Full vitest suite requires pnpm workspace setup.

## AI Disclosure

🤖 **AI-Assisted PR**
- Analysis: Claude Opus 4.5 (via Clawdbot)
- Implementation: OpenCode with GPT-5.2-Codex (xhigh) and Claude Opus 4.5 (high)
- Testing level: Lightly tested (logic verified, full suite not run due to workspace deps)
- I understand what this code does and have reviewed it

## Files Changed

- `src/agents/transcript-policy.ts` - Added `isClaudeModel()` helper and updated policy flags
- `src/agents/transcript-policy.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite
