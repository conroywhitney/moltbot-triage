## Description

Updates docker-compose to use the published GHCR image instead of the local moltbot  image.
This aligns the default CLI setup with the documented installation flow.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docker-compose.yml` to stop defaulting to a locally-built image and instead default to a published GHCR image, aligning the compose-based CLI/gateway workflow with the documented install flow. It also consolidates the previous `openclaw-gateway` + `openclaw-cli` split into a single `clawdbot` service that runs `node dist/index.js gateway ...` and enables interactive TTY settings.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge, but the compose changes can cause surprising behavior changes for existing users.
- The change is limited to `docker-compose.yml`, but it switches to a moving `:main` container tag and renames an expected gateway token env var; both can break existing setups or make behavior non-reproducible without additional documentation or pinning.
- docker-compose.yml
