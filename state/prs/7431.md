## Description

The default docker-setup.sh wasn't working viz Docker on MacOS, so updated it for Bash 3.x compatibility

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docker-setup.sh` to work on macOS’s default Bash 3.x by removing associative array usage in `upsert_env()` and replacing it with a plain array + membership check helper.

The rest of the script remains the same: it prepares config/workspace directories, generates a gateway token, optionally writes an extra compose file for mounts/volumes, persists key env vars into `.env`, builds the Docker image, runs interactive onboarding, and starts the gateway via `docker compose`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk and should be safe to merge after a quick sanity check on macOS Bash 3 and Bash 4+.
- Change is narrowly scoped to `upsert_env()` and primarily swaps a Bash 4 associative array for a Bash 3-compatible membership check. Main behavioral risk is subtle `.env` rewriting edge cases (e.g., duplicate keys or unusual lines), but the loop logic is otherwise unchanged.
- docker-setup.sh
