## Description

## Summary
Adds support for creating Discord **Forum posts** (channel type 15) using the existing `thread-create` action.

## What changed
- Accept optional initial post `message` content for `thread-create` (required by Discord for forum posts).
- Accept optional `appliedTagIds` to apply forum tags.
- Use `POST /channels/{channelId}/threads` when creating a forum post (and as fallback when no `messageId` is provided).

## Why
Forum channels require an initial message payload. Without it, Discord returns a generic "This field is required" error and forum posts cannot be created.

## Notes
- Uses a raw route string for forum thread creation because `discord-api-types` does not currently provide a helper for the create-forum-post endpoint.

Added support for Discord  and  passthrough on the  tool schema and Discord send pipeline. This enables clean embedded posts (PRs/issues/weekly/PRDs) and lays groundwork for buttons in command-center. Commit: ca2ab303b.

### @Solvely-Colin (2026-01-29)

I added support for Discord embed + component passthrough in the message tool schema and Discord send pipeline.

This enables clean embedded posts (PRs/issues/weekly/PRDs) and lays groundwork for buttons in command-center.
