## Description

What happened
Running ./docker-setup.sh (or docker build ...) fails at RUN pnpm build
Error mentions missing:
/app/apps/shared/ClawdbotKit/Tools/CanvasA2UI
/app/vendor/a2ui/renderers/lit

Why
.dockerignore ignores apps/ and vendor/ entirely  ￼
But scripts/bundle-a2ui.sh requires those paths as inputs  ￼
Dockerfile copies repo with COPY . ., so ignored paths never enter build context  

Reproduction
git clone https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.git
cd clawdbot
./docker-setup.sh
# or: docker build -t clawdbot:local .

Environment
•OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (Vultr VPS)
•Docker / Docker Compose versions: 
<img width="635" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1029f59-8af4-4d8b-85f3-c41d77eee3bd" />
Docker Compose version v5.0.2

Commit/branch: 
main e79dd527b

Expected
Docker build succeeds on main

Proposed fix
Adjust .dockerignore to not exclude required A2UI paths, or re-include them using negation patterns, or change Dockerfile/build pipeline to fetch/build A2UI deps in-image.
