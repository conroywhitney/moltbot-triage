## Description

Summary

fix docker-setup.sh run failed on macOS

Root Cause

docker-setup.sh uses declare -A, which requires Bash 4+. macOS ships Bash 3.x by default, so declare -A fails.

#2781

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docker-setup.sh` to avoid Bash 4-only associative arrays by replacing the `declare -A seen` usage in `upsert_env` with an array + membership helper, which addresses macOS’s default Bash 3.x limitation. It also updates defaults and compose invocations to use `moltbot-*` service/image naming (and updates the printed docs link), which changes how the script interacts with `docker-compose.yml` and the user’s workflow.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is probably safe to merge, but it includes a potentially breaking rename in a script intended as a compatibility fix.
- The Bash 3 compatibility change in `upsert_env` is small and straightforward, but the same diff also changes default image and compose service names; if the compose file/services aren’t updated in lockstep (or users rely on the old names), the script will fail. No tests cover this script, so runtime validation is manual.
- docker-setup.sh

**`docker-setup.sh`**
[P1] This PR changes the default image/service names (clawdbot → moltbot) in addition to the Bash-3 fix.

The stated goal is macOS compatibility for `declare -A`, but this also changes the default `CLAWDBOT_IMAGE` fallback and the compose service names invoked (`... run ...-cli`, `... up ...-gateway`). If `docker-compose.yml` still defines the old service names, this script will fail at runtime; even if it’s updated elsewhere, bundling a rename into this fix is easy to miss for reviewers/users.
