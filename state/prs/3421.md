## Description

## Summary

Three improvements to autoCapture and autoRecall in memory-lancedb.

## Changes

### 1. Skip System Prompts in Capture and Recall

System-generated messages now excluded from both capture and recall:
- Heartbeat prompts (`HEARTBEAT.md`, `Read HEARTBEAT.md`)
- Security webhook messages (`[SECURITY DETECTION - ANALYZE]`)
- Pre-compaction flush prompts
- `HEARTBEAT_OK` / `NO_REPLY` responses

These messages clutter memory and produce irrelevant recall context.

### 2. Strip Injected Memory Context

When autoRecall is enabled, it prepends `<relevant-memories>` to user messages. Added `stripMemoryContext()` helper to cleanly extract the user's actual message before evaluating capture criteria.

### 3. Improved Recall Relevance

Old behavior:
- Threshold: 0.3 (too loose)
- Return first 3 matches

New behavior:
- Threshold: 0.5 (stricter)
- Fetch 8 candidates
- Re-rank by: `score × recency × importance`
- Recency factor: 1.0 for today, decays to 0.5 over 60 days
- Importance factor: uses stored importance field (default 0.7)
- Return top 3 after re-ranking

## Testing

Tested in production with:
- Heartbeat prompts no longer trigger recall
- Security webhook messages excluded
- Recalled memories are more recent and relevant
- Memory DB stays clean of system messages

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the memory-lancedb plugin’s heuristics for auto-capture/auto-recall by (1) skipping a handful of system-generated prompts, (2) stripping injected `<relevant-memories>` context before evaluating capture triggers, and (3) tightening recall (higher similarity threshold, more candidates, and a recency/importance re-rank) before injecting the top results back into context.

Overall, the approach fits the existing plugin lifecycle hooks (`before_agent_start` for recall, `agent_end` for capture) and uses the existing LanceDB search wrapper (`MemoryDB.search`) as the retrieval backend.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge and should improve memory quality, with a small correctness issue in the importance weighting fallback.
- Changes are localized to capture/recall heuristics and don’t alter storage schema or external APIs. The main functional concern is the `importance || 0.7` fallback in re-ranking, which can mis-rank memories with `importance = 0`.
