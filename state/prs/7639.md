## Description

## Task
[Bug]: Missing 'zop' module at extension/mattermost and remote package error in @openclaw/mattermost

## Description
## Summary

What went wrong?

1. The 'zop' module is missing from the local environment during Mattermost configuration.
2. There is an error with the remote package files when running npm install @openclaw/mattermost.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version:2026.2.1
- OS:Ubuntu 24.04
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc):npm

## Agent Analysis
The task outlines two primary issues: a missing 'zop' module during Mattermost configuration in a local environment, and an error with the remote package files when running `npm install @openclaw/mattermost`. To address these issues, we need to focus on fixing or adding configurations that may handle these dependencies.

1. **Missing 'zop' Module Issue**: Given the information and the file repository provided, there is no direct mention or usage of a 'zop' module. It's possible that this is a typo or misconfiguration related to another module. Since `zod` appears frequently in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` and is a common module for schema validation that might be used in similar contexts as 'zop', it could be that 'zop' was intended to be 'zod'.

2. **Error with Remote Package Files**: This seems like it might be related to how the package `@openclaw/mattermost` is being installed or specified. Given that there is no direct reference to `@openclaw/mattermost` in the provided `pnpm-lock.yaml`, ...

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds an `AGENT_CHANGE.md` file describing an agent’s analysis of a reported Mattermost install/config issue (missing “zop” module and `npm install @openclaw/mattermost` errors). No repository code, extension package manifests, or lockfiles are actually modified, so the reported bug is not addressed by the changes in this PR.

To fix the underlying issue, changes likely need to land in the actual Mattermost extension/package (`extensions/mattermost/**`, relevant `package.json`s, and the real lockfile updates produced by the package manager), rather than committing an internal agent log with speculative dependency edits.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as a bug fix because it doesn’t change the code/deps involved in the reported issue.
- Only a new markdown log file is added; the proposed fixes are speculative and not applied. Merging would add noise without resolving the missing module / install error.
- AGENT_CHANGE.md
