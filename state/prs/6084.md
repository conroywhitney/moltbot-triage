<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new Telegram config knob (`channels.telegram.dynamicAgents`) to route inbound Telegram messages to dynamically generated per-user (DM) and/or per-group agents, and extends Telegram message context/session key generation accordingly. It also updates UI schema hints and adds tests covering the new routing behavior.

Key integration points are `buildTelegramMessageContext` (now accepts a merged `telegramCfg` and may bypass `resolveAgentRoute` when dynamic routing is enabled) and the Telegram message processor which passes the merged Telegram config through to context building.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the dynamic-routing path duplicates session-key construction and may drift from the canonical router behavior.
- Most changes are additive and covered by tests, but the dynamic route constructs `sessionKey`/`mainSessionKey` manually and hardcodes `matchedBy`, which can cause subtle behavior divergence from `resolveAgentRoute` over time. Minor schema/default and comment-language consistency issues remain.
