## Description

## Summary
Fixes #1838

The `dist/control-ui/` files were committed before the `dist/` gitignore rule became effective. These build artifacts get regenerated during builds, causing dirty repo errors that block the auto-update mechanism:

```
Update Result: ERROR
  Reason: rebase-failed
  error: cannot rebase: You have unstaged changes.
```

## Changes
- Removes `dist/control-ui/` files from git tracking (they remain locally)
- Respects the existing `dist/` entry in `.gitignore`

## Test Plan
- [x] After this change, `git ls-files dist/control-ui/` returns empty
- [x] Files still exist locally after checkout
- [x] Auto-update mechanism no longer sees dirty repo from these files

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This change removes previously committed `dist/control-ui/` build artifacts from Git tracking so they no longer make the working tree dirty during builds/auto-update (relying on the existing `dist/` `.gitignore` rule). No runtime behavior changes are introduced; the PR strictly deletes generated files from version control.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it only removes generated artifacts from Git tracking.
- The diff consists solely of deletions under `dist/control-ui/` and does not modify source code, configuration, or build logic. The only risk is procedural (ensuring the artifacts are indeed generated and not required at runtime), which is consistent with the stated intent and existing `dist/` ignore rule.
- No files require special attention

LGTM! Clean fix - removes build artifacts that should have been gitignored from the start. This will unblock auto-updates for affected users.
