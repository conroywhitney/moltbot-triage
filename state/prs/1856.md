## Description

## Summary
Fixes #1838

The `dist/control-ui/` files were committed before the `dist/` gitignore rule became effective. These build artifacts get regenerated during builds, causing dirty repo errors that block the auto-update mechanism:

```
Update Result: ERROR
  Reason: rebase-failed
  error: cannot rebase: You have unstaged changes.
```

## Changes
- Removes `dist/control-ui/` files from git tracking (they remain locally)
- Respects the existing `dist/` entry in `.gitignore`

## Test Plan
- [x] After this change, `git ls-files dist/control-ui/` returns empty
- [x] Files still exist locally after checkout
- [x] Auto-update mechanism no longer sees dirty repo from these files
