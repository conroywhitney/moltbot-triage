## Description

Hi team! You will find in this PR a new Inference Provider: [OVHcloud AI Endpoints](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/ai-endpoints/). OVHcloud is the leading cloud provider in Europe.

With raising concerns about security in the AI space, I think it could be a great idea to add an European Inference Provider to clawd, since OVH doesn't save nor read the prompts and outputs.

Cursor helped me for some bug I encountered (especially removing the store attribute in the payload of the LLM request, I was lost in the files!).

## Tests
All the tests, formats, and lints have been ran in local. Also, the bot has been tested in live with AI Endpoints and Telegram. It works well!

Thank you for your review, I'm available at @eliqsx on the Discord if you want to chat! Cheers! 😄
