## Description

## Summary

When a model is found in the inline provider config (`models.providers.*.models`), the `api` field was not being set, causing `"Unhandled API in mapOptionsForApi: undefined"` errors when using custom OpenAI-compatible providers like Ollama or LM Studio.

This fix ensures the `api` field is inherited from:
1. The model config itself (if specified)
2. The provider config's `api` field  
3. Falls back to `"openai-responses"` (consistent with the fallback model behavior on line 73)

## Problem

When configuring a custom provider like this:
```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "openai": {
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
        "apiKey": "lm-studio",
        "models": [
          {
            "id": "qwen/qwen3-vl-8b",
            "name": "Qwen3 VL 8B",
            "contextWindow": 16384
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The model resolution would find `inlineMatch` but return it without an `api` field, causing the pi-ai library's `mapOptionsForApi` function to throw an error.

## Solution

Added logic to ensure the `api` field is set when returning an inline model match, mirroring the existing fallback behavior.

## Test plan

- [x] Tested with LM Studio as OpenAI-compatible backend
- [x] Verified Discord channel receives responses correctly after fix

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes inline-provider model resolution in `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/model.ts` by ensuring models discovered from `cfg.models.providers.*.models` inherit an `api` value (model-level `api` → provider-level `api` → `"openai-responses"`). This aligns inline matches with the existing fallback model behavior so downstream `pi-ai` API option mapping no longer sees `api: undefined` for OpenAI-compatible custom backends.

One edge case to revisit: inline model/provider matching is done using normalized provider ids, but the added lookup pulls provider config via the raw `inlineMatch.provider` string, which can cause the provider `api` to be missed when config keys differ only by case/whitespace.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and addresses a real runtime error, with a minor edge-case risk around provider key normalization.
- The change is small and localized and should prevent `api` from being undefined for inline provider models. The main remaining concern is that provider config is fetched via an unnormalized key, so some configs could still silently fall back to `openai-responses` instead of the intended provider API.
