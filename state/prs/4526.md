## Description

## Summary

Fixes #4499

MiniMax was incorrectly included in `isReasoningTagProvider()`, causing `enforceFinalTag=true` for all MiniMax runs. Since MiniMax models don't output `<think>`/`<final>` tags, this caused all streaming content to be discarded, resulting in '(no output)' in the TUI.

## Root Cause

In `src/utils/provider-utils.ts`:
```typescript
if (normalized.includes('minimax')) {
  return true;  // ← This caused the issue
}
```

This led to:
1. `enforceFinalTag=true` for all MiniMax runs
2. Streaming code only extracted content inside `<final>` tags
3. MiniMax doesn't output `<final>` tags → empty result → '(no output)'

## Why Telegram worked

Telegram sends messages through a different code path (channel outbound) that doesn't apply `enforceFinalTag` filtering.

## Why restart fixed it

After TUI restart, historical messages are loaded from the transcript, which doesn't go through the streaming filter path.

## Changes

- Removed MiniMax from `isReasoningTagProvider()`
- Added documentation explaining why MiniMax was removed

## Testing

- Verified lint and format pass
- MiniMax should now stream responses correctly in TUI

关闭：无法复现问题。在官方 Docker 镜像和源码编译版本中测试 MiniMax 均正常工作，TUI 和 Telegram 都能正常显示响应。如果问题再次出现，请提供具体的复现步骤。
