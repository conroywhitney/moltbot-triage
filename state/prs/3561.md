## Description

Fixes #3533

## Problem

When both `~/.clawdbot` (legacy) and `~/.moltbot` (new) state directories exist, Moltbot enters a split-brain state:

- Pairing appears to succeed (`paired.json` contains the device)
- But the gateway returns: `disconnected (1008): pairing required` or `unauthorized`
- The warning "State dir migration skipped: target already exists" was printed, but Moltbot continued running

This happens because different parts of the system read/write different directories, causing credentials and pairing data to be stored in one location but read from another.

## Solution

Moltbot now refuses to start if both directories exist, displaying a clear error message with resolution options:
State directory conflict: both legacy and new directories exist.

Legacy: ~/.clawdbot
New: ~/.moltbot

To fix, choose ONE of these options:

Keep the legacy directory (recommended if you have existing data):
Remove or rename ~/.moltbot

Use the new directory:
Remove or rename ~/.clawdbot

Merge manually, then remove the legacy directory

Set an explicit state directory:
export MOLTBOT_STATE_DIR="~/.moltbot"
## Changes

- Add `StateDirConflictError` class for explicit error handling
- Add `detectStateDirConflict()` for early detection at CLI startup
- Throw error instead of warning in `autoMigrateLegacyStateDir()`
- Add comprehensive tests for conflict detection

## Testing

- Added 6 new tests for `detectStateDirConflict()`
- Updated existing test to expect `StateDirConflictError` instead of warning
- All unit tests pass
