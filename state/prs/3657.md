## Description

## Summary
Improves the UX of the Telegram pairing flow by making the approval command easily copyable.
## Changes
- Added formatCliCommandForCopy() helper function that wraps CLI commands in backticks for Markdown formatting
- Updated the Telegram pairing message to:
  - Use the actual pairing code instead of `<code>` placeholder
  - Enable Markdown parsing so the command renders as monospace text
  
## Before
Users had to manually replace `<code>` with the actual code.
## After

The command appears as monospace text with the real code, and users can tap it in Telegram to copy directly to the clipboard.

## Testing

- Tested by triggering the pairing flow with an unauthorized Telegram user
- Verified the command renders as copyable monospace text
- Confirmed tapping the command copies it to the clipboard

## Future Improvements

This pattern could be extended to other CLI commands shown in Telegram messages, such as:
- `/model` and `/models` response commands
- Help messages referencing CLI commands
- Any bot responses that include CLI instructions
