## Description

### Summary
This PR adds full support for **Together AI** as a model provider in Clawdbot, enabling users to authenticate and leverage Together AI’s catalog of open-source models (e.g., Llama 3.3, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM-4.7) via API key. The integration includes dynamic model discovery, static fallback catalog, CLI support, environment variable handling, and default model configuration.

### Changes
- **Added Together AI provider support**:
  - New `together` provider with OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (`https://api.together.xyz/v1`)
  - Static model catalog with pricing, context windows, and input types (text/image)
- **CLI & Auth Integration**:
  - New `--together-api-key` flag and `together-api-key` auth choice in onboard flow
  - Support for non-interactive setup and environment variable detection (`TOGETHER_API_KEY`)
  - Updated auth choice options and test coverage
- **Configuration & Defaults**:
  - Default model set to `together/zai-org/GLM-4.7`
  - Config application logic (`applyTogetherConfig`, `applyTogetherProviderConfig`) to merge models and set defaults
  - Auth profile handling via `setTogetherApiKey`
- **Documentation**:
  - New `docs/providers/together.md` with setup guide, model list, and environment notes
  - Added Together AI to index.md provider list
