## Description

## Summary

This PR moves the checks-macos and macos-app CI jobs from ci.yml to a dedicated ci-macos.yml workflow with native GitHub Actions path filtering. The macOS jobs will now only run on PRs that touch relevant files (Node source code, Swift app code, or related config files), preventing them from blocking unrelated PRs like docs-only changes.

## Motivation

macOS CI jobs were blocking PRs even when the changes didn't affect macOS-related code. This wastes CI minutes and delays PR merges unnecessarily.

## Changes

The new `ci-macos.yml` workflow only triggers on PRs that modify:
- **Node source**: `src/**`, `extensions/**`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `**/*.test.ts`
- **Swift app**: `apps/macos/**`, `.swiftlint.yml`, `.swiftformat`

PRs that only touch docs, Android, iOS, or other unrelated files will no longer trigger macOS runners.

## Test plan
