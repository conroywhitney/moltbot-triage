<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Added categorized error recovery system with user-friendly guidance and docs links. Errors are now classified into 12 categories (auth, billing, rate_limit, timeout, etc.), each with tailored recovery suggestions and documentation links. The enhanced error display is integrated across TUI (terminal) and dashboard views (chat, overview, logs, channels).

**Key changes:**
- New `error-recovery.ts` (backend) and `recovery.ts` (frontend) modules categorize errors and provide recovery metadata
- TUI error formatting enhanced with `formatRecoveryAssistantErrorText` showing title, suggestions, and docs links
- Dashboard views now render structured error callouts via new `error-callout.ts` component
- All referenced documentation paths exist and are valid

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- Safe to merge with minor maintenance consideration
- Well-structured feature addition with consistent patterns. One style concern about code duplication between backend/frontend error classification that could lead to maintenance issues over time.
- ui/src/ui/errors/recovery.ts duplicates logic from src/infra/error-recovery.ts
