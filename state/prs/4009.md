## Description

## Summary

When repairing orphaned trailing user messages, `buildSessionContext()` was called but messages bypassed the sanitization pipeline. This could cause `tool_result` blocks without matching `tool_use` blocks, leading to Anthropic API rejecting requests with "unexpected tool_use_id" errors.

**The fix:** Apply the full sanitization pipeline (`sanitizeSessionHistory`, `validateGeminiTurns`, `validateAnthropicTurns`, `limitHistoryTurns`) to rebuilt messages, matching the behavior of the initial sanitization at lines 502-524.

## Test Plan

- [x] Tested locally with WhatsApp bot that was experiencing this error
- [x] Confirmed the error no longer occurs after the fix
- [x] Linter passes (`npm run lint`)

## AI-Assisted PR 🤖

- [x] **AI-assisted:** This fix was developed with Claude (Opus 4.5)
- [x] **Testing level:** Fully tested - reproduced the bug, applied fix, verified resolution
- [x] **Understanding:** The fix ensures that when messages are rebuilt via `buildSessionContext()` after repairing orphaned user messages, they go through the same sanitization pipeline as the initial message processing, preventing tool_use/tool_result pairing mismatches

### Context
The bug was discovered when a WhatsApp bot session had an aborted request that created a branch in the conversation tree. When linearized, a `toolResult` was included without its corresponding `tool_use` block, causing the Anthropic API to reject the request.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This change fixes a subtle session-repair edge case in `runEmbeddedAttempt()` where rebuilding session context after repairing an orphaned trailing user message would bypass the normal transcript sanitization/validation pipeline. The new code runs rebuilt messages through `sanitizeSessionHistory()`, optional turn validators (`validateGeminiTurns` / `validateAnthropicTurns`), and `limitHistoryTurns()` before calling `activeSession.agent.replaceMessages()`, aligning behavior with the initial session sanitization done earlier in the function.

Overall this should prevent malformed tool_use/tool_result pairings (e.g., orphaned `tool_result` blocks) from reaching provider APIs like Anthropic and causing request rejections ("unexpected tool_use_id").

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge and addresses a real failure mode, with low behavioral risk outside the repair path.
- The change is localized and mirrors an existing sanitization/validation pipeline already used earlier in the same function, which reduces the chance of introducing new transcript-format bugs. Main remaining concern is maintainability: the pipeline is duplicated in two places and could drift over time, but that’s not an immediate functional correctness issue.
- src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts (keep the duplicated sanitization pipeline in sync with the earlier one)

**`src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts`**
[P2] Consider reusing the existing sanitization/validation/limit pipeline to avoid drift.

This block duplicates the earlier sanitize/validate/limit logic at `attempt.ts:502-525`, so future edits (e.g., adding a new validation step or recording cacheTrace stages) could update one path but not the other. A small local helper (or extracting the existing pipeline into a function) would keep both call sites in sync.
