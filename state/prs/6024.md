<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates config reload behavior so that hitting **Reload** discards unsaved local edits by resetting the config “dirty” state, and it tweaks the form-mode diff display to treat schema defaults as unchanged (avoiding false “dirty” indicators for default-valued fields like Max Concurrent).

Changes are localized to the UI config controller (`loadConfig` now supports a `resetDirty` option and is used by Reload flows) and the config view (`renderConfig` normalizes values using schema defaults before computing diffs).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, with a couple of edge-case behavior concerns around reload error handling and tuple-array schema defaults.
- The changes are small and well-scoped to UI state management and diff rendering. Main risk is user-visible state loss if reload fails after clearing dirty state, plus a correctness edge case in default normalization for tuple-typed arrays.
