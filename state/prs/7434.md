## Description

This PR adds a `.mailmap` file to correctly attribute commits made by contributor `WeatherPal-AI` that were inadvertently authored with a local system email (`ubuntu@...`).

**Verification:**
The following merged commits belong to `WeatherPal-AI`:
- `7c96bde3b` (docs: fix GitHub branding capitalization)
- `49a3e3795` (docs: fix missing apostrophes in FAQ headers)
- `23f0efbf0` (docs: use straight quotes for code terms)

This mapping ensures proper credit in the contribution graph. Contributor `@WeatherPal-AI` can confirm.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a repository-level `.mailmap` entry so commits authored as `Ubuntu <ubuntu@…compute.internal>` are attributed to the GitHub noreply identity for `WeatherPal-AI`. This improves contributor attribution in `git shortlog`, blame views, and tooling that honors `.mailmap`, without affecting runtime code.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it only adds a `.mailmap` entry for attribution.
- Change is documentation/metadata-only and does not affect runtime behavior. Main risk is minor: `.mailmap` formatting/order conventions and ensuring it maps the intended identities.
- `.mailmap` (validate mapping format and newline).

Confirming these commits are mine. Thanks for the fix @Protocol-zero-0.

### @greptile-apps (2026-02-02)

Perfect! Thanks for confirming those commits are yours. The `.mailmap` file will properly attribute your contributions going forward, so your work gets the credit it deserves in the contribution graph and git history. 

This is a clean fix that helps maintain proper attribution without affecting any code functionality. 👍
