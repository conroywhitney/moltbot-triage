## Description

## What

Rename GCP to Google Cloud and standardize all 6 VPS platform docs to follow a consistent 8-section template.

## Why

The VPS documentation had inconsistent section naming and ordering across different providers. This makes it harder for users to navigate and compare guides. Standardizing creates a predictable structure users can rely on.

## Changes

**GCP Rename:**
- `gcp.md` → `google-cloud.md`
- Added redirects for `/gcp` and `/platforms/gcp`

**Template standardization (all 6 docs):**
1. Goal
2. Prerequisites
3. Quick Path
4. Step-by-step Guide
5. Persistence
6. Cost
7. Troubleshooting
8. See Also

**Navigation:**
- Added all 6 VPS platforms to sidebar (alphabetical): digitalocean, exe-dev, fly, google-cloud, hetzner, oracle

**Sections added where missing:**
| Doc | Added |
|-----|-------|
| google-cloud.md | Cost |
| fly.md | Persistence, See Also |
| hetzner.md | Cost, Troubleshooting, See Also |
| exe-dev.md | Persistence, Cost, Troubleshooting, See Also |
| oracle.md | Quick Path (moved Cost after Persistence) |
| digitalocean.md | Quick Path (moved Cost after Persistence) |

## Notes

- Existing detail levels preserved (Docker guides stay detailed, direct-install guides stay simple)
- Friendly variants like "What are we doing (simple terms)" kept as sub-sections
- Cost comparison tables kept in each doc for context
