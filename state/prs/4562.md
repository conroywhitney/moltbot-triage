## Description

The Nostr channel was calling a non-existent handleInboundMessage method on the plugin runtime. This refactors the onMessage handler to use the correct API pattern:

- Build proper MsgContext with all required fields
- Finalize context with finalizeInboundContext
- Record session metadata with recordInboundSession
- Create reply dispatcher with createReplyDispatcherWithTyping
- Dispatch to agent with dispatchReplyFromConfig

This follows the same pattern used by Matrix, MS Teams, and Mattermost channel extensions.

Fixes #4547

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Nostr inbound DM handler to follow the standard channel pipeline used by other extensions: resolve an agent route, build/finalize an inbound `MsgContext`, record session metadata, create a reply dispatcher (with no-op typing hooks for Nostr), and dispatch via `dispatchReplyFromConfig` instead of calling a non-existent `handleInboundMessage` API.

Overall the refactor aligns Nostr with Matrix/Mattermost/Teams patterns and should restore inbound message handling; the main area to double-check is the `MsgContext` addressing fields (`To`/`OriginatingTo`) to ensure routing/session keys and reply targeting behave as intended for DMs.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with one DM addressing detail to verify.
- Change is localized to Nostr inbound handling and follows established patterns from other channel extensions; the main risk is subtle behavior changes if `MsgContext.To`/`OriginatingTo` are expected to reference the peer/room rather than the bot account id, which could affect session routing or replies.
- extensions/nostr/src/channel.ts (verify `To`/`OriginatingTo` semantics for Nostr DMs)
