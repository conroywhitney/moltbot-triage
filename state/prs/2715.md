## Description

Add Nebius Token Factory Provider


Summary:
Adds Nebius as a new model provider with support of Open models using their OpenAI-compatible API.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds Nebius TokenFactory as a first-class model provider: it introduces `NEBIUS_API_KEY` env resolution, adds an implicit provider definition pointing at `https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1`, and wires Nebius into onboarding (interactive + non-interactive), model-picker provider preferences, `models list` env probing, and documentation.

The integration follows the existing pattern used for other OpenAI-compatible providers (provider entry under `models.providers`, onboarding creating an auth profile, and a provider-specific default-model helper). The main issues are around mismatched identifiers (default model ref vs registered models) and a broken export/name for the Nebius API-key setter, which would prevent onboarding from working.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is due to a broken onboarding credential setter and mismatched default model refs.
- The PR is conceptually straightforward, but there is at least one definite compile/runtime failure (`setNebiusApiKey` is imported/used but not actually defined/exported; `seNebiusApiKey` is). Additionally, the Nebius default model ref appears inconsistent with the models being registered, which can break model selection during onboarding. Once these are corrected, remaining issues are mostly small typos/docs polish.
