## Description

## Summary

Add documentation for integrating OpenClaw with [Portkey](https://portkey.ai), an AI gateway that provides observability, governance, cost tracking, and reliability features.

- Add dedicated Portkey provider doc with quick start, config examples, and troubleshooting
- Add Portkey mentions where relevant
- Tested and verified working with `@openai/gpt-5.2` and `@anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`

## Changes

- **New:** `docs/providers/portkey.md` - Full integration guide
- **Updated:** `docs/providers/index.md` - Added Portkey to provider list
- **Updated:** `docs/concepts/model-providers.md` - Added Portkey section with config example
- **Updated:** `docs/gateway/local-models.md` - Added Portkey as proxy/gateway option
- **Updated:** `docs/gateway/configuration.md` - Added Portkey to custom providers list
- **Updated:** `docs/testing.md` - Added Portkey to the custom endpoints list

## Key features documented

- Unified OpenAI-compatible API (`api: "openai-completions"` works for all providers, including Anthropic)
- Model ID format: `@provider/model` (e.g., `@anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, `@openai/gpt-5.2`)
- Portkey Configs for fallbacks, load balancing, caching, and retries
- Tracing with `x-portkey-trace-id` header
- Budget controls and rate limits

## Test plan

- [x] Verified OpenAI model via Portkey: `@openai/gpt-5.2`
- [x] Verified Anthropic model via Portkey: `@anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new Portkey provider documentation page and references Portkey across existing docs where OpenAI-compatible proxies/gateways and custom `models.providers` are discussed.

Changes are limited to documentation: adding `docs/providers/portkey.md` (quick start, configuration examples, tracing/budget tips, troubleshooting) and updating provider indexes and gateway/model-provider docs to mention Portkey as an option.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; changes are documentation-only with a couple of wording/clarity nits to address.
- No runtime code changes. The main risks are user confusion from categorizing Portkey as a local proxy and a small typo/formatting issues in docs.
- docs/providers/portkey.md; docs/gateway/local-models.md; docs/providers/index.md

[P2] Typo in heading: “Venius” vs “Venice”.

The heading currently says `## Highlight: Venius (Venice AI)`; if the product is “Venice AI” (and the link text below says Venice), this should likely be:
