## Description

This PR ensures that Clawdbot starts a new thread when replying to a message in a Mattermost channel, instead of sending a top-level message.

- Fallback to `post.id` as `threadRootId` if `post.root_id` is missing. Posts in a channel don't have a `root_id` until there are actual answers in a thread.
- Excludes DMs to maintain standard direct messaging behavior (unthreaded unless already in a thread).

Reviewed and tested by actual humans.

Thanks, but we've patched our local installation, and it's working just fine :)
