## Description

## Summary
- Use the configured default agent model for LLM slug generation instead of falling back to Anthropic defaults.
- Prevent /new hook failures in setups that only configure non-Anthropic providers (e.g., google-antigravity + google-gemini-cli).

## Details
Slug generation uses a temporary embedded agent without specifying provider/model, which defaults to Anthropic. In environments without Anthropic auth, /new triggers FailoverError and can disrupt message handling. This change resolves the default model from config and passes provider/model into the embedded run.

## Testing
- Not run (local reproduction from a live server setup).

## AI Assistance
AI-assisted (OpenCode). Prompt history available on request.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the LLM-based slug generator hook to use the default model configured for the resolved default agent, instead of implicitly falling back to the global Anthropic defaults. Concretely, `src/hooks/llm-slug-generator.ts` now calls `resolveDefaultModelForAgent({ cfg, agentId })` and passes the returned `{ provider, model }` into `runEmbeddedPiAgent`, preventing failures in environments where Anthropic is not configured but other providers are.

This fits existing patterns in the codebase: other embedded/agent flows resolve a model ref from config (with agent overrides) before running, while the embedded runner itself still retains a final fallback to `DEFAULT_PROVIDER/DEFAULT_MODEL` if nothing is provided.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is narrowly scoped (one hook), follows existing model-selection utilities, and simply plumbs an already-supported `provider/model` pair into `runEmbeddedPiAgent` to avoid unintended Anthropic defaults. No behavior changes outside slug generation and no new side effects beyond selecting the configured default model.
- No files require special attention

Note: formal_conformance failure is from fork permissions (Resource not accessible by integration) and is informational. Main CI checks are otherwise passing; remaining macOS/Windows jobs are still queued/running.
