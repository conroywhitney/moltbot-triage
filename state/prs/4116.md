## Description

**Subject**: chore(docker): Upgrade Node.js base image to v24 (Active LTS)

**Description**: This PR upgrades the application runtime environment from Node.js 22 to Node.js 24. Transitioning to the latest Active LTS version ensures the following benefits:

**Security Posture**: Ensures the container includes the latest security patches and mitigations for CVEs present in older runtimes.

**Performance**: Leverages the updated V8 engine for better execution speed and improved memory management (garbage collection).

**Long-Term Support**: Aligns the infrastructure with the official Node.js support lifecycle, preventing technical debt accumulation.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Docker base image from `node:22-bookworm` to `node:24-bookworm` to align the container runtime with Node.js 24 (Active LTS). The rest of the Dockerfile (Bun install, pnpm/corepack usage, build steps, and switching to the non-root `node` user) remains unchanged and continues to define the build/runtime environment for the app.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with low risk, as it is a straightforward base image bump.
- The diff only changes the Node base image tag; the only concrete issue found is a stale comment referencing the old image version. Runtime/CI compatibility with Node 24 should still be validated in the usual pipeline, but no code-path changes are introduced here.
- Dockerfile (minor comment mismatch)

**`Dockerfile`**
[P2] Comment references old base image version

The security-hardening comment still says `node:22-bookworm`, but the base image is now `node:24-bookworm`. This can mislead future edits/debugging about which image/user is expected.

```suggestion
# The node:24-bookworm image includes a 'node' user (uid 1000)
```
