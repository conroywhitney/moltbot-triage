## Description

**Subject**: chore(docker): Upgrade Node.js base image to v24 (Active LTS)

**Description**: This PR upgrades the application runtime environment from Node.js 22 to Node.js 24. Transitioning to the latest Active LTS version ensures the following benefits:

**Security Posture**: Ensures the container includes the latest security patches and mitigations for CVEs present in older runtimes.

**Performance**: Leverages the updated V8 engine for better execution speed and improved memory management (garbage collection).

**Long-Term Support**: Aligns the infrastructure with the official Node.js support lifecycle, preventing technical debt accumulation.
