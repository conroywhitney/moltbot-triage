## Description

…d SMTP sender; env example updates

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds two new root-level utility scripts: a Slack Socket Mode bot scaffold (`scripts/slack-bot.js`) and an SMTP sender helper (`scripts/send-email.js`), and wires them into `package.json` as `pnpm slack:run` and `pnpm send:email`. Also introduces `nodemailer` as a dependency (lockfile updated accordingly).

These scripts are currently standalone tooling under `scripts/` rather than integrated into `src/` channel implementations, providing a quick way to prototype Slack event handling and send outbound email from the repo.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge; the main concerns are operational/safety defaults in the Slack bot script rather than core runtime changes.
- Changes are additive and isolated to new scripts plus a single new dependency. The biggest issues are that the Slack script currently logs event payloads and auto-joins all public channels by default, which can cause data leakage/noise/rate limits if someone runs it in a real workspace. No deeper cross-cutting code paths were modified.
