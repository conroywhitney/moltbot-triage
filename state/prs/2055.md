## Description

## Summary
- Split system-prefixed lines out of user messages into separate system entries in the Control UI
- Render system messages centered with muted styling to avoid looking like user chat
- Skip rendering an empty user bubble when a message contains only system lines

## Testing
- pnpm --dir ui test -- ui/src/ui/chat/message-normalizer.test.ts
  - Note: UI test suite reports existing failures in ui/src/ui/navigation.test.ts (icon expectations), unrelated to this change.
