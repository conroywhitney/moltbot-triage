## Description

Currently, both the logger (server-side) and the logs CLI command force UTC time using `.toISOString()`. This makes debugging difficult for users in non-UTC timezones.

This PR changes log formatting to use local time offsets for:
1. `src/logging/logger.ts`: Writing logs to file with local timezone offset.
2. `src/cli/logs-cli.ts`: Formatting logs in the CLI (`--follow`) using local time instead of UTC.

This ensures logs match the user's system time both on disk and in the terminal.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates timestamp formatting to avoid forced UTC in two places: the gateway file logger (`src/logging/logger.ts`) and the `openclaw logs` CLI pretty output (`src/cli/logs-cli.ts`). The intent is to make timestamps align with the user’s local timezone.

Notable behavior to double-check: the CLI still prints UTC timestamps in `plain` mode (and when not in pretty/TTY mode), and the logger now writes both a derived `time` field (local-with-offset) and the original `date` field from `tslog` (which may serialize as UTC), which can create inconsistent timestamps within one JSON line if downstream parsers choose the other field.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the timezone change is only partially applied in the CLI and may create inconsistent timestamps in log records.
- Changes are localized and low-risk, but there are user-visible consistency issues: `logs --plain` still emits UTC, and the file logger may emit both `date` (UTC-serialized) and `time` (local offset) in the same JSON line depending on how `logObj` is shaped/serialized.
- src/cli/logs-cli.ts, src/logging/logger.ts
