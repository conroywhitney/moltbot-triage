## Description

## Problem
When a sub-agent spawned via `sessions_spawn` fails (network error, timeout, model error), the result returns `Findings: (no output)` with no indication of what went wrong.

## Solution
Populate `findings` with contextual error information when no assistant reply is available:
- For errors: `Error encountered:\n<error message>`
- For timeouts: `Task timed out before producing output.`
- For unknown status: `Task ended with unknown status.`

## Testing
- Tested locally on a live moltbot instance
- Linted with `npm run lint`

## Before
```
Findings: (no output)
```

## After
```
Findings: Error encountered:
fetch failed sending request
```
