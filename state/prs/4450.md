<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the root `Dockerfile` to ensure the `extensions/memory-core` workspace package has its dependencies installed during the image build, preventing runtime config validation failures when `plugins.slots.memory` is set to `memory-core`.

The change fits the repo’s plugin system by making sure the default bundled memory plugin (`memory-core`) is actually present/usable in Docker builds used by `./docker-setup.sh` deployments.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and should fix the reported Docker build/runtime issue.
- Change is small and localized to the Docker build. Main concern is reproducibility: doing a nested `pnpm install` without `--frozen-lockfile` can drift from the repo lockfile and make builds less deterministic.
- Dockerfile
