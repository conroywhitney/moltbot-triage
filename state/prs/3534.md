## Description

Clarify instructions for using ad-hoc signing in the packaging script. 

Without this flag, macos will report building failure.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the macOS developer setup guide to clarify how to build/package the app without an Apple Developer ID certificate by explicitly opting into ad-hoc signing via `ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1` when running `scripts/package-mac-app.sh`.

This aligns the dev-setup docs with the packaging/signing scripts’ behavior (ad-hoc signing is an explicit opt-in) and points developers to the macOS app README for deeper signing/run-mode troubleshooting.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s a small, localized documentation clarification.
- Only one markdown file is updated, and the new instruction (`ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1 ./scripts/package-mac-app.sh`) matches existing documented/scripted behavior elsewhere in the repo (e.g., mac signing docs and macOS app README). No code or config changes are introduced.
- No files require special attention
