## Description

This PR introduces the Pollinations AI provider integration and improves the CLI user experience regarding terminal persistence.

Key Changes:

Pollinations AI Integration:
Added pollinations provider support with a comprehensive model catalog: openai (default), minimax, mistral, qwen-coder, and more.
Configured API Key authentication via POLLINATIONS_API_KEY environment variable.
Fully integrated into the onboard and configure interactive wizards.
Enabled automatic provider detection when the API key is available in the environment.
Terminal Persistence Enhancement:
Modified the setup command to include a "Press Enter to close" prompt when running in interactive environments (like the dashboard terminal). This prevents the terminal session from closing immediately after the tasks are finished.
Internal Updates:
Updated onboarding types and authentication schemas to include the new Pollinations choices.
