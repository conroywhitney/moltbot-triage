## Description

## Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  - Fix Google Antigravity OAuth authentication failure caused by Google blocking HTTP localhost redirects                                                                                                                                                    
  - Change redirect URI from `http://localhost:51121` to `http://127.0.0.1:51121`                                                                                                                                                                             
 
## Why
Google's OAuth 2.0 security policy blocks `http://localhost` redirects but explicitly allows loopback IP addresses (`127.0.0.1`) for native app flows. This is documented in [Google's OAuth 2.0 policy](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies#secure-response-handling).
