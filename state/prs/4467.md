## Description

## Summary
Fixes #4368

`DEFAULT_SANDBOX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` was hardcoded to `~/.openclaw/sandboxes`, ignoring the `MOLTBOT_STATE_DIR` environment variable. This caused `~/.clawdbot/sandboxes/` to be recreated even when `MOLTBOT_STATE_DIR=~/.moltbot` was set.

## Changes
- Moved the `resolvedStateDir` variable to the top of the file (before `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`)
- Updated `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to use `resolvedStateDir` instead of hardcoded path
- Removed the duplicate `resolvedSandboxStateDir` variable (now reuses `resolvedStateDir`)

## Testing
- Lint: ✅ passed
- Build: ✅ passed
- Awaiting CI for full test suite

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates sandbox path constants so the default workspace root now derives from the resolved global state directory (`STATE_DIR`) rather than always using `~/.openclaw`. It also removes a duplicate “resolved sandbox state dir” variable and reuses the shared resolved state dir for both `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` and `SANDBOX_STATE_DIR`, aligning sandbox storage with the configured state directory behavior in the rest of the codebase.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small refactor in a single constants file: it switches the default sandbox workspace root to be derived from the already-established `STATE_DIR` resolution logic and removes a redundant variable. The new behavior is consistent with how state directory overrides are resolved elsewhere (`src/config/paths.ts`), and there are no new control flows or I/O introduced.
