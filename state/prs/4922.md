## Description

Fixes parallel tool results getting chained parentIds instead of all pointing to assistant message. Causes API 400 errors.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes transcript parentId behavior for parallel tool results by branching back to the originating assistant message before appending each `toolResult` (including synthetic ones generated during flush). It adds tests to ensure multiple tool results from the same assistant message all share that assistant message as `parentId`, avoiding chained toolResult parents that can violate strict provider ordering (e.g., Anthropic’s requirement that `tool_result` blocks immediately follow the assistant message containing the `tool_use` blocks).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but has a plausible edge case that could re-parent unexpected tool results.
- Core change is localized and covered by new tests for the intended parallel tool-result behavior. The main concern is that branching currently applies to any `toolResult` while `assistantEntryId` is set, even if the result doesn’t correspond to a pending tool call, which could corrupt transcript structure in uncommon ordering scenarios.

**`src/agents/session-tool-result-guard.ts`**
[P1] `toolResult` messages with unknown IDs still get re-parented

When `assistantEntryId` is set, this branches for *any* incoming `toolResult` (even if `extractToolResultId()` returns `null` or the id isn’t in `pending`). In scenarios like a stray/delayed tool result or a tool result after `pending` was flushed, this will re-parent that entry under the most recent assistant-with-toolcalls and can corrupt transcript structure.

Consider only branching when the tool result id exists **and** is currently pending (or otherwise known to belong to that assistant).

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
