## Description

Problem:

The hardcoded version 1.11.x caused "version no longer supported" errors on the 2026-01-29 gateway update.

The 1.15.8 API now strictly enforces the presence of the input field in tool_use payloads, leading to Field required crashes.

Solution:

Updated version strings to antigravity/1.15.8 across the Google Provider.

Refactored tool-use logic to ensure a mandatory input object (even if empty) is always included in the payload.

Verified on M2 Mac with Node v25.5.0.

Verification:

openclaw doctor confirmed as valid.

Tested complex tool calls without schema errors.

This has already been fixed in the package, so you should update it rather than patch it.
