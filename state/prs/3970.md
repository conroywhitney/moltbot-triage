## Description

## Summary

Fixes mobile viewport issues on iOS Safari and makes navigation sticky on mobile/tablet.

## Changes

### Viewport fixes
- Add `viewport-fit=cover` and `maximum-scale=1.0` to prevent iOS sizing issues
- Add `overflow: hidden` on html/body to prevent content overflow
- Add iOS safe-area-inset padding for notch support

### Sticky navigation  
- Make topbar sticky at `top: 0` on mobile/tablet (≤1100px)
- Make nav sticky at `top: var(--shell-topbar-height)` below topbar

## Problem

On iPhone (tested on iPhone 17 Pro Max), the Control UI was:
1. ~15% too wide and tall, requiring scroll to see the full interface
2. Navigation tabs scrolled away when scrolling chat content

## Testing

Tested on iPhone 17 Pro Max via Tailscale Serve.
