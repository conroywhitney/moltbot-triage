## Description

## Summary

Fixes mobile viewport issues on iOS Safari and makes navigation sticky on mobile/tablet.

## Changes

### Viewport fixes
- Add `viewport-fit=cover` and `maximum-scale=1.0` to prevent iOS sizing issues
- Add `overflow: hidden` on html/body to prevent content overflow
- Add iOS safe-area-inset padding for notch support

### Sticky navigation  
- Make topbar sticky at `top: 0` on mobile/tablet (≤1100px)
- Make nav sticky at `top: var(--shell-topbar-height)` below topbar

## Problem

On iPhone (tested on iPhone 17 Pro Max), the Control UI was:
1. ~15% too wide and tall, requiring scroll to see the full interface
2. Navigation tabs scrolled away when scrolling chat content

## Testing

Tested on iPhone 17 Pro Max via Tailscale Serve.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

These changes adjust the UI’s mobile rendering by (1) updating the HTML viewport meta to include `viewport-fit=cover` and `maximum-scale=1.0`, (2) disabling document-level overflow on `html, body`, and (3) adding mobile/tablet CSS to support iOS safe-area insets and make the topbar/nav sticky.

The overall approach aligns with the app’s existing layout model where `.shell` is a fixed-height grid container and `.content` is the primary scroll container (`ui/src/styles/layout.css`). The main risks are scope/side-effects: global `overflow: hidden` on the entire document and applying a `.shell` height override to all <=1100px devices that support `env()` (even when safe-area insets are 0).

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the CSS changes have a non-trivial chance of causing scroll/viewport regressions on other pages/devices.
- Viewport and sticky-nav changes are small and localized, but `overflow: hidden` on `html, body` and the broad `.shell` height override under `@supports (env())` can have unintended side effects outside the original iOS Safari scenario. No automated test validation was shown for layout regressions.

**[P2] `maximum-scale=1.0` reduces accessibility (pinch-zoom)**

Adding `maximum-scale=1.0` in the viewport meta (`ui/index.html:5`) prevents users from pinch-zooming, which is an accessibility concern and is discouraged by mobile a11y guidance. If the sizing issue is specifically iOS Safari’s viewport quirks, `viewport-fit=cover` + CSS fixes usually suffice without disabling zoom.
