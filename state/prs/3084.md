## Description

## Summary

Include the JSONL entry `id` in messages returned by `readSessionMessages()`, providing stable unique identifiers for each message.

## Problem

The `chat.history` gateway method returns messages without unique identifiers. Downstream consumers (custom dashboards, external integrations, MCP clients) must fall back to array indices for message IDs, which are unstable when messages are filtered, compacted, or new messages arrive.

This causes issues for chat UIs that:
- Deduplicate messages by ID (indices shift when messages are added/removed)
- Use message IDs as rendering keys (causes unnecessary re-renders and state loss)
- Track "seen" messages across polling intervals (false positives/negatives)

## Solution

Changed `messages.push(parsed.message)` to `messages.push({ ...parsed.message, id: parsed.id })` in `src/gateway/session-utils.fs.ts`.

Each JSONL transcript entry already has a unique `id` field. This change spreads that ID onto the message object, making it available to `chat.history` consumers.

## Testing

- [x] **Live tested** - Running in production with a custom chat integration for ~1 week
- [x] Confirmed understanding of the code and impact
- [x] Added unit tests for `readSessionMessages` to verify `id` is included

The unit tests verify:
- Messages with stable IDs are preserved
- Messages without IDs handle gracefully (id: undefined)
- Invalid JSON and empty lines are skipped
- Message content and metadata are preserved
- Nonexistent files return empty array

## Notes

- Non-breaking change - adds an optional `id` field to returned messages
- Consumers that don't use `id` are unaffected
- Single line change in production code + comprehensive test coverage

### @dominicnunez (2026-01-28)

This change is actively being used and tested in a custom chat interface that polls `chat.history` for real-time message updates. Without stable IDs, the UI had to fall back to array indices which caused duplicate messages to appear after compaction and message deduplication to fail during polling intervals.
