## Description

## Summary

- Changed `gateway stop` to use `launchctl stop` instead of `launchctl bootout`
- This keeps the service registered, allowing `gateway start` to work without reinstalling

## Problem

`gateway stop` was using `launchctl bootout` which completely unloads the LaunchAgent from launchd. After running `gateway stop`, `gateway start` would fail with:

```
Gateway service not loaded.
Start with: moltbot gateway install
```

## Solution

Use `launchctl stop gui/$UID/<label>` instead of `launchctl bootout`. This stops the service but keeps it registered, so `gateway start` works as expected.

The `bootout` behavior is still used in `uninstallLaunchAgent` where full removal is intended.

## Test plan

- [x] Existing launchd tests pass (14 tests)
- [x] Lint/type check pass
- Manual verification: `gateway stop` → `gateway start` should work without reinstalling

Fixes #3780
