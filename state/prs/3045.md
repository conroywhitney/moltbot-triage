## Description

## Summary

Fixes #3031

When a subagent completes and announces its result back to the main agent, the main agent's pending tasks were being lost due to a race condition between the followup queue drain and the announce flow.

## Changes

- **Add persistence layer** for followup queues (similar to subagent runs persistence pattern)
- **Implement 30-second grace period** before deleting empty queues to handle subagent announce race conditions
- **Persist queue state** after enqueue/dequeue operations
- **Track `emptyAt` timestamp** to prevent premature queue deletion
- **Add periodic cleanup** for expired empty queues

This ensures that when a subagent completes and triggers a new main agent invocation, any pending tasks in the followup queue are preserved and restored from disk.

## Files Changed

- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/state.store.ts` (new) - Persistence layer for followup queues
- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/state.ts` - Add persistence calls and restore logic
- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/enqueue.ts` - Persist after enqueue operations
- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/drain.ts` - Grace period logic and persist after drain

## Testing Status

⚠️ **Lightly tested**
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ Linter passes (oxlint)
- ⚠️ No integration tests yet for the specific race condition scenario
- ⚠️ Needs real-world validation with live moltbot instance

## AI-Assisted Development

🤖 This PR was created with assistance from Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Analyzed the codebase to identify root cause
- Designed fix following existing persistence patterns (subagent-registry.ts)
- Generated issue #3031 and implementation code
- Testing level: **lightly tested** (compiles + lints, needs integration testing)

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows existing patterns (persistence similar to `subagentRuns`)
- [x] Linter passes
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Integration tested (needs validation)
- [x] Marked as AI-assisted
- [x] References issue #3031

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds on-disk persistence for followup queues to prevent pending tasks being lost when a subagent completion triggers a new main-agent invocation. The change introduces a `state.store.ts` JSON registry under `STATE_DIR`, restores queues on first access, persists after enqueue/dequeue/clear operations, and adds a 30s grace period plus periodic cleanup before deleting empty queues to avoid the announce/drain race described in #3031.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, with a small risk of leaving empty queues around longer than intended due to a timestamp edge case.
- Changes are localized and follow existing persistence patterns, but there is at least one concrete logic issue (`emptyAt` cleared before confirming enqueue) that can defeat the cleanup mechanism, plus some extra steady-state disk I/O and lack of validation on restored JSON.
- src/auto-reply/reply/queue/enqueue.ts, src/auto-reply/reply/queue/drain.ts, src/auto-reply/reply/queue/state.store.ts

## Comments

### @sid1943 (2026-01-28)

The Windows test failure in `src/config/paths.test.ts` is unrelated to this PR. This PR only modifies files in `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/`:

- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/state.store.ts` (new)
- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/state.ts`
- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/enqueue.ts`
- `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/drain.ts`

The failing test `CONFIG_PATH prefers existing legacy filename when present` is in `src/config/paths.test.ts`, which was recently updated in main branch (commit afd57c7e2). This appears to be a Windows-specific test flake or environmental issue with the recent path changes.
