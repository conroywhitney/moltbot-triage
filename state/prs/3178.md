## Description

## Problem

The current extractGeminiCliCredentials logic assumes a Unix-style symlink structure where realpathSync resolves to a binary inside a package directory.

On Windows global npm installations, gemini is often a .cmd shim located directly in the npm prefix folder. Additionally, depending on the npm version and installation method, gemini-cli-core might be nested inside gemini-cli/node_modules rather than being flat.

This caused 'Gemini CLI not found' errors on Windows environments even when the CLI was correctly installed and accessible via PATH.

## Solution

- Updated the path resolution logic to check dirname(resolvedPath) in addition to the parent directory, covering Windows npm shim behavior.
- Added search paths to look for nested gemini-cli-core installations (e.g., .../gemini-cli/node_modules/@google/gemini-cli-core).

## Testing

- Verified on Windows 11 with a global npm installation.
- Before fix: clawdbot models auth login failed to find the CLI.
- After fix: Auth flow initiates correctly and credentials are extracted.
