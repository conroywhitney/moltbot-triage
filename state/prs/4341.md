## Description

## Problem
Google's Antigravity API now requires User-Agent version 1.15.8 or higher. Users are getting "This version of Antigravity is no longer supported" error when trying to use Antigravity features.

## Solution
This PR patches the `@mariozechner/pi-ai@0.49.3` dependency to update the Antigravity User-Agent header from version `1.11.5` to `1.15.8`.

## Changes
- Created a pnpm patch for `@mariozechner/pi-ai@0.49.3`
- Updated the `ANTIGRAVITY_HEADERS` User-Agent from `antigravity/1.11.5 darwin/arm64` to `antigravity/1.15.8 darwin/arm64`

## Testing
- [x] Tested locally with Antigravity authentication
- [x] Confirmed the API no longer returns version error

Fixes the issue where Antigravity authentication fails with "This version of Antigravity is no longer supported" error.
