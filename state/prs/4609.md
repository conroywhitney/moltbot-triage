## Description

## Summary
This PR integrates the [Hipocap](https://github.com/hipocap/hipocap) governance and security layer alongside Laminar observability into OpenClaw. It adds real-time protection against prompt injections, automated policy enforcement, and deep execution tracing.

Everything in this security layer is designed to run seamlessly within **Docker** containers, ensuring isolated and consistent performance. Users can configure these settings directly during the **onboarding process**. For detailed configuration and usage, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.hipocap.com).


> [!WARNING]
> While this integration significantly hardens OpenClaw against prompt injections and system exploitation (mitigating an estimated 95% of common attacks), it does not guarantee 100% security. Note that **hard blocking of functions is not yet integrated, but will be added soon**; instead, Hipocap acts as a **security advisor** for OpenClaw, advising the agent to be cautious of the data it is interacting with. Users should still follow best practices for sandbox and credential management.

## Key Integration's

## Security with Hipocap
- **Middleware Integration**: Intercepts user prompts and tool results for security analysis.
- **Moltbot Sentinel**: A context-aware security persona that balances system safety with developer flexibility.
- **Onboarding**: Added a dedicated setup flow to auto-initialize high-security policies.
- **Docker Isolation**: Core security services are containerized to maintain strict environment boundaries.

## Observability with Laminar
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implementation of spans for tool execution and message handling.
- **Security Insights**: Security decisions (advisories/blocks) are now visible within traces.

## How to Test
1. Set up the Hipocap server following the instructions at [github.com/hipocap/hipocap](https://github.com/hipocap/hipocap).
2. Run `openclaw configure` to provide your Hipocap **API Key** and **User ID**, and to enable the security layer.
3. Verify the `moltbot` policy is created on the Hipocap server.
4. Check the Laminar dashboard for execution traces after any agent interaction.

## Goal of the PR

The primary goal of this PR is to make the integration of the [Security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security) policies **simple, efficient, and straightforward to set up**.

This work focuses on reducing configuration complexity, improving usability, and enabling teams to adopt and apply these security policies with minimal effort and high reliability.
