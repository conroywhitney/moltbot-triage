## 🌟 Key Features
- **Core Engine**: Domain-agnostic agent runtime.
- **New Agents**: Sports, Crypto, Security, Creative.
- **Architecture**: Modular Action Executor & Permission System.
- **Branding**: New visual identity and humanized documentation.
## ⚠️ Notes
- Replaces legacy Twilio integration with a modular plugin architecture (Twilio connector to be re-added as a plugin in v0.2).

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR repurposes the repository into a Python/FastAPI-based “SotyBot” agent engine MVP, adding an agent registry + base interface, action executor, permission/audit components, a Typer CLI, Docker/compose setup, and pytest coverage; docs and env templates are updated accordingly.

Main correctness concerns are around missing core modules (`engine.core.*`) and config mismatches: multiple modules/Docker/CLI/docs reference `engine.core.app` and `engine.core.models`, but `engine/core/` isn’t present in the changeset, which will prevent the engine from starting and break imports/tests. There are also several attribute mismatches in settings usage (e.g., `settings.action.max_execution_time`, `settings.audit.log_directory`, `settings.audit.enable_database_logging`) and the compose healthcheck points to `/health` which is not implemented. Tests include at least one call to a non-existent registry method (`get_agent_capabilities`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 1/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is because the engine entrypoint and shared model imports point to missing modules.
- Multiple core modules are referenced (`engine.core.app`, `engine.core.models`) but not included in the changeset, which will break container startup, CLI serving, and imports across executor/registry/audit/permissions/tests. Additional config attribute mismatches and a failing healthcheck/test indicate CI/runtime failures even after adding the missing modules unless those are corrected too.
- Dockerfile, cli/main.py, engine/actions/executor.py, engine/audit/logger.py, config/settings.py, docker-compose.yml, engine/agents/registry.py, tests/test_agents.py
