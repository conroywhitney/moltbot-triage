## Description

  Overview
  This PR improves code maintainability and production stability by cleaning up unnecessary debug logs and removing
  dead code. It standardizes logging practices by migrating from console.log to the project's internal logging
  system.

  Key Changes
   1. Standardized Logging in Skills Workspace (src/agents/skills/workspace.ts):
      - Migrated from console.log to skillsLogger.debug.
      - This prevents cluttering the standard output in production and allows better control over log levels via the
        subsystem logger.
   2. Cleaned up Session Memory Hook (src/hooks/bundled/session-memory/handler.ts):
      - Removed multiple verbose console.log statements used during development.
      - Ensures internal housekeeping tasks remain silent and professional.
   3. Refactored OTEL Service Tests (extensions/diagnostics-otel/src/service.test.ts):
      - Removed a redundant empty constructor in the Resource mock.
      - Removed the corresponding eslint-disable comment, improving overall test code quality.
