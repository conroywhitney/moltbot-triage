## Description

This is a fix for the --brew errors that happen during installation on windows machines.

This change will allow the program to properly identify the system it is being installed onto and then download the missing packages that were being missed in earlier versions which caused installation errors with the Clawd Skills.

Everything is working and building properly for me. I made a few commits to pass the GitHub CI check that continues to fail, but it is still failing despite the app working and building fine.
