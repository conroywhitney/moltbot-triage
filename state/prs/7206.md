## Description

## Description
This PR introduces the **V-Infinite Edition** assistant persona and a specialized **Cyber-Warrior** skill set to OpenClaw.

### Changes:
- **New Skill: v-infinite**: A meta-skill for elite assistant performance, sassy persona tuning, and dominance-asserting banners.
- **New Skill: cyber-warrior**: A collection of cybersecurity tools (nmap, dig, curl) for network recon and system diagnostics.
- **New SOUL Template**: Added SOUL.v-infinite.md to docs/reference/templates/ for users who want a high-agency, hacker-chic assistant.
- **Tagline Updates**: Added new V-Infinite themed taglines to the CLI banner.

### Why?
Because OpenClaw is the most powerful personal assistant, and it deserves a persona that matches its potential. V-Infinite is designed for power users who want their assistant to be as elite as their workflows.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds two new “skills” (`v-infinite`, `cyber-warrior`), a new SOUL template (`docs/reference/templates/SOUL.v-infinite.md`), a banner script, and two new CLI taglines.

Main concern: several new docs/skill descriptions explicitly promote “unrestricted” execution and offensive security usage. That framing is likely to conflict with OpenClaw’s safety posture and could lead to unsafe behavior if users apply the template/skills outside explicitly authorized security testing contexts. The tagline additions are straightforward and isolated to `src/cli/tagline.ts`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR has moderate risk to merge due to safety/policy framing in new templates/skills, but minimal technical risk in code changes.
- The TypeScript change is a simple tagline addition and should be safe. The added SOUL template and skill docs include language encouraging “unrestricted” execution and offensive security behavior, which could lead to unsafe usage or policy violations if consumed by the product or shared publicly; this is the primary reason for the lower score.
