## Description

# Summary

- Adds missing firecrawl nested object schema to tools.web.fetch config
- Adds missing readability boolean to tools.web.fetch config
- Fixes config validation error: Unrecognized key: "firecrawl"

## Details

The tools.web.fetch schema used .strict() (equivalent to additionalProperties: false) but was missing the firecrawl and readability properties that were already:

1. Documented in uiHints (tools.web.fetch.firecrawl.*)
2. Used by the code in src/agents/tools/web-fetch.ts

This prevented users from configuring self-hosted Firecrawl instances via config since baseUrl has no env var fallback.

## Test plan

- Added test to ensure config works
- Type check passes
- All tests pass
- Lint passes


Fixes #2527
