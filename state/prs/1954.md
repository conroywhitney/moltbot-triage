## Description

## Summary
- Add xAI provider with dynamic model discovery following the Venice pattern
- Query xAI's `/v1/models` endpoint at runtime (requires `XAI_API_KEY`)
- Static catalog as fallback with Grok 4.1, 4, 3, 2 series models
- Merge API response with catalog metadata for known models
- Auto-discover new models not in catalog

## Test plan
- [x] Build passes (`pnpm build`)
- [x] All 11 xAI model tests pass (`pnpm test src/agents/xai-models.test.ts`)
- [x] All models-config tests pass
- [x] Lint/format pass
- [x] Manual verification: `XAI_API_KEY=test-key pnpm clawdbot models list --all | grep "^xai/"` shows all 10 Grok models
