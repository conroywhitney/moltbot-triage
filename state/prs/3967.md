## Description

When running in a sandbox, agents receive prompt information about their workspace location. Previously, `buildEmbeddedSandboxInfo` returned the host machine's path (for example, `/tmp/moltbot-sandbox`), but tools execute inside a Docker container where the workspace is mounted at `/workspace`.

This PR fixes the mismatch by using the container's internal path.

Before:
```js
workspaceDir: sandbox.workspaceDir
//            → "/tmp/moltbot-sandbox"
```

After:
```js
workspaceDir: sandbox.containerWorkdir
//            → "/workspace"
```
