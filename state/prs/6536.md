## Description

When adding a cron job via cron.add without explicitly setting enabled, the job was created with enabled=undefined. Since the code checks would never get a nextRunAtMs calculated and would never fire.

The tool documentation already states 'enabled: true | false // Optional, default true' but the code didn't implement this default.

This adds the missing default in normalizeCronJobCreate().

Debugged and fixed with AI pair programming (Claude). Tested locally with Telegram — verified jobs now get `enabled: true` and fire correctly.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes cron job creation defaults by ensuring `enabled` is set to `true` when omitted during normalization.

The change is localized to `src/cron/normalize.ts` inside `normalizeCronJobInput()`: when `applyDefaults` is enabled (used by `normalizeCronJobCreate()`), jobs that don’t specify `enabled` now get `enabled: true`, preventing jobs from remaining inert due to `enabled` being `undefined`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small, targeted defaulting behavior applied only when `applyDefaults` is true (creation path), aligning runtime behavior with documented defaults and avoiding impact on patch/update flows.
- No files require special attention
