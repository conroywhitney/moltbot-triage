<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds an explanatory comment to the empty `catch` in `ensureDir()` (`src/memory/internal.ts`) to document why errors from `mkdirSync` are ignored.

The change is documentation-only and doesn’t alter runtime behavior. The main review point is that with `mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true })`, the referenced `EEXIST` scenario is usually not the error you’ll see when the directory already exists, so the comment may be misleading; consider rephrasing and/or moving the comment for clarity.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge and is documentation-only, with minor wording accuracy concerns.
- The change only adds a comment and does not affect code paths. The only issue is potential inaccuracy/misleading wording about `EEXIST` behavior with `recursive: true`.
- src/memory/internal.ts
