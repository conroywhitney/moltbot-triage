## Description

## 🐛 Bug Fix
Legacy state migrations were leaving hardcoded absolute paths (e.g., from `~/.clawdbot/sessions/`) in the `sessionId` and `sessionFile` fields of `sessions.json`. This caused issues when the state was moved to a different machine or user.

## 🔧 Changes
- Updated `normalizeSessionEntry` in `src/infra/state-migrations.ts` to use `path.basename` to strip paths from `sessionId`.
- Removed the `sessionFile` field during migration, as it's no longer used in the new session structure and often contains absolute paths.
- Added a regression test verifying that paths are stripped and `sessionFile` is removed.

## 🧪 Testing
- [x] Added regression test to `doctor-state-migrations.test.ts`.
- [x] All state migration tests pass.

## 🦞 Lobster Checklist
- [x] Small bug fix
- [x] Includes test
- [x] No breaking changes

Fixes: #5631

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates legacy state migration normalization so that `sessionId` values that were accidentally persisted as absolute paths are reduced to a portable identifier using `path.basename(...)`, and it drops the legacy `sessionFile` field from migrated session entries. A regression test was added to ensure path stripping and field removal occur when migrating `sessions.json` into the per-agent state layout under `agents/<id>/sessions/`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but has a meaningful behavior change in sessionId normalization that should be double-checked against downstream expectations.
- The change is small and covered by a regression test, but `path.basename(rawSessionId, ".jsonl")` both strips directories and drops the `.jsonl` extension, which may alter semantics for legacy states that stored `sessionId` as a filename rather than an ID. If any consumers expect `sessionId` to include the extension, migrations could point at the wrong session artifact.
