## Description

#### **Summary**
This PR addresses 6 missing documentation areas identified by a Codex review. It provides structural clarity for contributors and strengthens agent security rules. [Issue](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/issues/2662)

#### **Key Additions**
- **Agent Role Catalog**: Added [docs/reference/agent-roles.md] to define Gateway, Runner, and Subagent responsibilities and handoff protocols.
- **Tooling Policy**: Added [docs/reference/tooling-policy.md] listing preferred search and edit tools.
- **Ownership Map**: Added [docs/reference/ownership.md] mapping directories to domain owners and identifying entry points.
- **New Channel Checklist**: Added [docs/channels/adding-channels.md] providing a step-by-step guide for adding messaging providers.
- **Release Sequence**: Updated [docs/reference/RELEASING.md]  with a high-level sequence summary.
- **Security Guardrails**: Updated [AGENTS.md]  with "Never Read/Write" rules and secrets handling guidelines.

#### **AI Context & Testing**
- **AI-Assisted**: Yes (built with Antigravity/Claude).
- **Testing**: Fully tested by verifying documentation links and cross-referencing with the current codebase implementation.
- **Confirmation**: I have reviewed the generated documentation and confirmed it accurately reflects the existing project structure and workflows.

#### **Checklist**
- [x] AI-assisted mark added
- [x] Documentation cross-referenced
- [x] Tested locally (link/format check)
