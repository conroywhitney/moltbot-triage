## Description

## Summary

- Adds legacy `clawdbot-*` client IDs to `GATEWAY_CLIENT_IDS` for backward compatibility after the clawdbot → moltbot rename

## Problem

After the rename from `clawdbot` to `moltbot` (commit 6d16a658e), the gateway schema validation rejects connections from older macOS/iOS/Android apps that still send the legacy client IDs (`clawdbot-macos`, `clawdbot-ios`, `clawdbot-android`).

**Error seen in the macOS app:**
```
invalid connect params: at /client/id: must be equal to constant; at /client/id: must match a schema in anyOf
```

This breaks connectivity for users running a pre-rename app against a post-rename gateway.

## Solution

Add the legacy client IDs to the allowed list so older apps can still connect:
- `clawdbot-control-ui`
- `clawdbot-macos`
- `clawdbot-ios`
- `clawdbot-android`
- `clawdbot-probe`

## Test plan

- [x] Verified macOS app version 2026.1.22 (7530) with `clawdbot-macos` client ID can connect to updated gateway
- [x] Build passes
