## Description

## Problem

When a streaming response is aborted mid-tool-call (due to network issues, timeouts, or rate limits), the tool call may be incomplete. The assistant message is saved with:
- `stopReason: "aborted"`
- `partialJson` containing incomplete JSON

The transcript repair logic in `session-transcript-repair.ts` was still extracting tool calls from these aborted messages and inserting synthetic `tool_result` blocks for them.

When the conversation is sent to Anthropic API, the aborted `tool_use` block may be invalid/incomplete, causing the API to reject the request:

```
messages.X.content.Y: unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks: toolu_XXXX.
Each tool_result block must have a corresponding tool_use block in the previous message.
```

This permanently corrupts the session until manually repaired.

## Solution

Check for `stopReason === "aborted"` in `extractToolCallsFromAssistant()` and return early with an empty array, preventing synthetic result insertion for incomplete tool calls.

## Testing

Added two test cases:
1. Verifies that tool calls from aborted messages are skipped
2. Verifies that normal tool calls (with `stopReason: "toolUse"`) still work correctly

Fixes #4475

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates transcript repair to avoid extracting tool calls from assistant messages that ended with `stopReason: "aborted"`, preventing insertion of synthetic `tool_result` blocks for incomplete/malformed tool calls. It also adds tests covering the aborted case and a non-aborted `stopReason: "toolUse"` case to ensure normal repair behavior remains intact.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is narrowly scoped (early return when `stopReason === "aborted"`) and directly prevents a known API validation failure mode. The added unit tests cover both the new aborted behavior and the expected non-aborted behavior, and there are no risky side effects on other message roles or repair logic.
- No files require special attention
