## Description

## Problem

When a streaming response is aborted mid-tool-call (due to network issues, timeouts, or rate limits), the tool call may be incomplete. The assistant message is saved with:
- `stopReason: "aborted"`
- `partialJson` containing incomplete JSON

The transcript repair logic in `session-transcript-repair.ts` was still extracting tool calls from these aborted messages and inserting synthetic `tool_result` blocks for them.

When the conversation is sent to Anthropic API, the aborted `tool_use` block may be invalid/incomplete, causing the API to reject the request:

```
messages.X.content.Y: unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks: toolu_XXXX.
Each tool_result block must have a corresponding tool_use block in the previous message.
```

This permanently corrupts the session until manually repaired.

## Solution

Check for `stopReason === "aborted"` in `extractToolCallsFromAssistant()` and return early with an empty array, preventing synthetic result insertion for incomplete tool calls.

## Testing

Added two test cases:
1. Verifies that tool calls from aborted messages are skipped
2. Verifies that normal tool calls (with `stopReason: "toolUse"`) still work correctly

Fixes #4475
