## Description

## Problem

Telegram DM reply threads were not working correctly. When a user replied within a thread in a DM conversation with the bot, responses were sent to the main chat instead of staying in the thread.

## Root Cause

`buildTelegramMessageContext` was returning `resolvedThreadId` for all chat types. However, `resolveTelegramForumThreadId()` returns `undefined` for non-forum chats (including DMs), because it's designed specifically for forum topic resolution.

This meant DM reply threads lost their `messageThreadId` context during delivery.

## Fix

For DM chats, use the raw `messageThreadId` directly instead of `resolvedThreadId`. Forum groups continue to use `resolvedThreadId` where topic resolution is needed.

```typescript
// Before
resolvedThreadId,

// After  
resolvedThreadId: isGroup ? resolvedThreadId : messageThreadId,
```

## Testing

- ✅ DM reply threads now receive responses in the correct thread
- ✅ Streaming replies work
- ✅ Followup queue (subagents) delivers to correct thread
- ✅ Forum groups unaffected
