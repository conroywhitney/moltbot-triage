## Description

## Problem

Telegram DM reply threads were not working correctly. When a user replied within a thread in a DM conversation with the bot, responses were sent to the main chat instead of staying in the thread.

## Root Cause

`buildTelegramMessageContext` was returning `resolvedThreadId` for all chat types. However, `resolveTelegramForumThreadId()` returns `undefined` for non-forum chats (including DMs), because it's designed specifically for forum topic resolution.

This meant DM reply threads lost their `messageThreadId` context during delivery.

## Fix

For DM chats, use the raw `messageThreadId` directly instead of `resolvedThreadId`. Forum groups continue to use `resolvedThreadId` where topic resolution is needed.

```typescript
// Before
resolvedThreadId,

// After  
resolvedThreadId: isGroup ? resolvedThreadId : messageThreadId,
```

## Testing

- ✅ DM reply threads now receive responses in the correct thread
- ✅ Streaming replies work
- ✅ Followup queue (subagents) delivers to correct thread
- ✅ Forum groups unaffected

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes Telegram DM reply-thread routing by preserving `message_thread_id` for direct messages instead of relying on `resolveTelegramForumThreadId()` (which intentionally returns `undefined` for non-forum chats). Forum/supergroup topic handling continues to use the resolved forum thread id.

The change is localized to `src/telegram/bot-message-context.ts`, adjusting the context returned by `buildTelegramMessageContext` so downstream delivery can include the correct thread id for DMs.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and fixes a real DM threading issue with low surface area.
- The change is small and localized, and the underlying reasoning (forum resolver returning undefined for DMs) matches Telegram semantics. Main remaining risk is semantic overload of `resolvedThreadId` potentially confusing downstream usage/logging, but it’s unlikely to break functionality immediately.
- src/telegram/bot-message-context.ts (thread id naming/semantics)
