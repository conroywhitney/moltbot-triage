## Description

## Summary

Fixes #4636

WhatsApp voice messages were being saved as 0-byte files while image downloads worked correctly.

## Problem

The `downloadMediaMessage` function from Baileys 7.x returns empty data for audio messages when using `"buffer"` mode, but works correctly with `"stream"` mode.

## Changes

- Changed `downloadInboundMedia()` from `"buffer"` mode to `"stream"` mode
- Manually collect stream chunks and concatenate into buffer
- Added validation to detect and handle empty buffers gracefully

## Testing

| Test Case | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Voice message (ogg/opus) | 0 bytes ❌ | 11488 bytes ✅ |
| Image (jpg) | Works ✅ | Works ✅ |
| Video | Not tested | Should work |

## Environment

- Baileys: 7.0.0-rc.9
- Node.js: v22.22.0
- OS: Linux (Debian)
