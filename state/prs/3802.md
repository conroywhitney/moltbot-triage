<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docs/plugin.md` to add a new “Community Plugins” section, and documents an initial community plugin (ClawdBoost) with a short description, install command, and external links (npm/GitHub/author). This extends the existing plugin documentation by giving users a curated place to discover third‑party extensions.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the doc rendering should be checked for markdown formatting/link policy consistency.
- Only documentation changes are involved, so runtime risk is low; the main risk is incorrect markdown fencing or inconsistent documentation conventions that would degrade rendering and clarity.
- docs/plugin.md

**`docs/plugin.md`**
[P1] The fenced code block for the installation command looks malformed in the PR description (it shows `\\\ash`), and if the same formatting made it into `docs/plugin.md` it will render incorrectly. In markdown this should be a normal fenced block like ```bash / ```.

```suggestion
```bash
npm install clawdboost
```
```

**`docs/plugin.md`**
[P2] Please ensure outbound links in the new Community Plugins section follow the repo’s doc/link conventions (some repos require reference-style links or explicit "community-maintained" disclaimers). If there’s no policy, consider adding a short note that these plugins are community maintained and not officially supported to reduce user confusion.
