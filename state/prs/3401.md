## Description

## Summary

Two fixes for autoCapture reliability in memory-lancedb.

## Problem 1: Injected Memory Context Blocks Capture

When autoRecall is enabled, it prepends `<relevant-memories>` to user messages:
```
<relevant-memories>
The following memories may be relevant...
</relevant-memories>

User's actual message here
```

The `shouldCapture()` function was checking for `<relevant-memories>` in the text and skipping it entirely. This meant **user messages were never captured** when both autoRecall and autoCapture were enabled.

**Fix:** Add `stripMemoryContext()` helper to remove the injected context before evaluating capture criteria.

## Problem 2: Scanning Full History Instead of Current Turn

The agent_end handler was:
1. Extracting ALL messages from conversation history (could be 100+)
2. Filtering through shouldCapture
3. Taking the first 3 that passed

In long sessions, recent messages were at the end of the array and never processed. The first 3 messages that matched were often from much earlier in the conversation.

**Fix:** Only process the **last user message** and **last assistant message** — the current turn. Previous turns were already captured when they occurred.

## Changes

- Add `stripMemoryContext()` helper function
- Update `shouldCapture()` to strip context before filtering
- Rewrite agent_end handler for turn-by-turn capture
- Strip context from text before storing

## Testing

Tested in a 250+ message session:
- Before: Recent messages (e.g., "I got an espresso machine for Christmas") never captured
- After: Each turn captures the current user + assistant exchange

Memory DB grew from 1072 → 1082 entries correctly capturing conversation turns.
