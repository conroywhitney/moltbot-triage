## Description

## Summary

Two fixes for autoCapture reliability in memory-lancedb.

## Problem 1: Injected Memory Context Blocks Capture

When autoRecall is enabled, it prepends `<relevant-memories>` to user messages:
```
<relevant-memories>
The following memories may be relevant...
</relevant-memories>

User's actual message here
```

The `shouldCapture()` function was checking for `<relevant-memories>` in the text and skipping it entirely. This meant **user messages were never captured** when both autoRecall and autoCapture were enabled.

**Fix:** Add `stripMemoryContext()` helper to remove the injected context before evaluating capture criteria.

## Problem 2: Scanning Full History Instead of Current Turn

The agent_end handler was:
1. Extracting ALL messages from conversation history (could be 100+)
2. Filtering through shouldCapture
3. Taking the first 3 that passed

In long sessions, recent messages were at the end of the array and never processed. The first 3 messages that matched were often from much earlier in the conversation.

**Fix:** Only process the **last user message** and **last assistant message** — the current turn. Previous turns were already captured when they occurred.

## Changes

- Add `stripMemoryContext()` helper function
- Update `shouldCapture()` to strip context before filtering
- Rewrite agent_end handler for turn-by-turn capture
- Strip context from text before storing

## Testing

Tested in a 250+ message session:
- Before: Recent messages (e.g., "I got an espresso machine for Christmas") never captured
- After: Each turn captures the current user + assistant exchange

Memory DB grew from 1072 → 1082 entries correctly capturing conversation turns.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR improves `memory-lancedb` autoCapture reliability by (1) stripping the `<relevant-memories>…</relevant-memories>` block injected by autoRecall before deciding whether to capture/store a message, and (2) changing the `agent_end` handler to only consider the current turn (last user + last assistant messages) instead of scanning the entire conversation history.

The changes fit into the plugin’s lifecycle-hook pipeline: autoRecall injects context in `before_agent_start`, and autoCapture persists high-signal snippets in `agent_end` after embedding + dedupe against LanceDB.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge and should improve autoCapture correctness, with minor edge cases to consider.
- The change is localized to one plugin file and the core logic (strip injected recall context + process only current turn) matches the described bugs. Main remaining concerns are around message selection in `agent_end` (ensuring the captured assistant text is actually the final user-facing reply) and making `stripMemoryContext` less prone to accidental truncation if tags appear unexpectedly.
