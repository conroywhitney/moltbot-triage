## Description

- What:
  - Request <all_urls> host permission for the Moltbot Browser Relay extension so Chrome exposes the “On all sites” Site access option.

- Why:
  - Without “On all sites”, the relay extension could not reliably attach to regular https tabs in our setup; enabling “On all sites” resolved the issue.

- Testing:
  - Manually tested on Ubuntu + Chrome:
    - Opened https://example.com and https://myaccount.google.com
    - Set extension Site access to “On all sites”
    - Verified attach works (badge ON) and CDP relay works.

- AI-assisted:
  - Yes (assisted by an AI agent). Changes reviewed and tested manually.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Chrome extension manifest to request broad host permissions (`<all_urls>`) so Chrome exposes the “On all sites” site access option, enabling the extension to attach to arbitrary tabs in the reported setup. The change is isolated to `assets/chrome-extension/manifest.json` and expands the extension’s host access beyond localhost.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk functionally but increases permission scope significantly.
- The change is a single manifest edit and should not break runtime behavior, but requesting `<all_urls>` meaningfully broadens host access and can affect user trust and store review requirements.
- assets/chrome-extension/manifest.json
