## Description

- What:
  - Request <all_urls> host permission for the Moltbot Browser Relay extension so Chrome exposes the “On all sites” Site access option.

- Why:
  - Without “On all sites”, the relay extension could not reliably attach to regular https tabs in our setup; enabling “On all sites” resolved the issue.

- Testing:
  - Manually tested on Ubuntu + Chrome:
    - Opened https://example.com and https://myaccount.google.com
    - Set extension Site access to “On all sites”
    - Verified attach works (badge ON) and CDP relay works.

- AI-assisted:
  - Yes (assisted by an AI agent). Changes reviewed and tested manually.
