## Description

fixes #2796

### Summary

Previously, plugin installation derived the install directory from the npm package name,
ignoring the `id` defined in `clawdbot.plugin.json`. This forced verbose plugin IDs and caused
warnings when the manifest ID differed from the package name.

This PR updates the installer to prefer the manifest `id` when available, while keeping the
`package.json` name as a fallback to preserve backward compatibility.

### Changes
- Prefer `clawdbot.plugin.json` `id` as `pluginId`
- Fallback to `package.json` name when manifest ID is missing
- Added tests to verify correct installation behavior with manifest-based IDs

### Result
Plugins can now use clean, short IDs without breaking existing plugins or workflows.
