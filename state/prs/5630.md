## Description

## Summary

Extracts a unified `withTimeout` utility function to reduce code duplication across the codebase.

## Changes

- Add `src/utils/with-timeout.ts` with configurable timeout and custom error message
- Add comprehensive unit tests for `withTimeout`
- Add **consistency tests** to verify behavior matches original implementations
- Refactor `slack/probe.ts` to use unified `withTimeout`
- Refactor `line/probe.ts` to use unified `withTimeout`

## Consistency Verification

Created dedicated consistency tests that compare the new implementation against the original inline implementations:

| Test Case | Original | New | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----|--------|
| Normal completion | ✅ | ✅ | Match |
| Timeout error message | `"timeout"` | `"timeout"` | Match |
| timeoutMs=0 | Returns directly | Returns directly | Match |
| timeoutMs=-1 | Returns directly | Returns directly | Match |
| Error propagation | ✅ | ✅ | Match |

## Benefits

- Reduces code duplication (7+ similar implementations in codebase)
- Consistent behavior across all usages
- Easier to maintain and test
- Other files can be refactored incrementally

## Testing

- 7 unit tests for `withTimeout`
- 5 consistency tests comparing with original implementation
- 128 existing tests in `slack/` and `line/` modules pass

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR introduces a shared `src/utils/with-timeout.ts` helper and updates the Slack and LINE probe flows to use it (passing `"timeout"` to preserve the old error string). It also adds unit tests plus “consistency” tests that compare the new helper against the previous inline implementations.

Overall the refactor looks low-risk and the new helper matches the prior behavior for the call sites touched. The main items to watch are (1) `withTimeout`’s `!timeoutMs` check, which can silently treat `NaN` the same as `0` and skip timeouts, and (2) one timing-based unit test that’s likely to be flaky in CI.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minor follow-up tweaks.
- The change is a contained refactor with good test coverage and call-site preservation of the legacy timeout error message. Remaining concerns are limited to edge-case input handling (`NaN`/falsy timeout values) and a potentially flaky, timing-based test; neither suggests a broad behavioral regression for typical usage.
- src/utils/with-timeout.ts; src/utils/with-timeout.test.ts
