## Description

This prevents Telegram polling from silently getting stuck when persisted state is corrupted and avoids multi-poller conflicts.

Changes:
- Validate persisted `lastUpdateId` (must be a safe integer within the 32-bit Bot API range). If invalid, back up the file and start from a null offset.
- Add a per-bot polling lock (account + token hash) to prevent multiple concurrent `getUpdates` loops.
- Wire the lock + offset sanitize into the polling monitor.

Notes:
- Cross-platform: no systemd dependencies.
- Escape hatch: set `CLAWDBOT_ALLOW_MULTI_TELEGRAM_POLL=1` to disable the poll lock.

Tests:
- `pnpm vitest run src/telegram/update-offset-store.test.ts src/telegram/poll-lock.test.ts`

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR hardens Telegram long-polling by (1) validating and backing up corrupted persisted `lastUpdateId` state before starting, and (2) adding a per-bot polling lock (account + token hash) to prevent multiple concurrent `getUpdates` loops. The monitor now acquires the lock before starting polling, logs invalid offset recovery via `onInvalid`, and ensures the lock is released on exit (including webhook mode).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, with low-to-moderate risk around edge-case lock reclamation and test flakiness.
- Core behavior changes (offset sanitization + file backup, single-poller lock acquisition/release) are straightforward and covered by targeted unit tests. Main remaining concerns are an edge case where lock owner detection can misclassify a reused PID as alive on Linux when startTime isn’t available, and the new timing-sensitive test which may be flaky under CI load.
- src/telegram/poll-lock.ts, src/telegram/poll-lock.test.ts
