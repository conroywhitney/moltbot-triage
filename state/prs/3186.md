## Description

This prevents Telegram polling from silently getting stuck when persisted state is corrupted and avoids multi-poller conflicts.

Changes:
- Validate persisted `lastUpdateId` (must be a safe integer within the 32-bit Bot API range). If invalid, back up the file and start from a null offset.
- Add a per-bot polling lock (account + token hash) to prevent multiple concurrent `getUpdates` loops.
- Wire the lock + offset sanitize into the polling monitor.

Notes:
- Cross-platform: no systemd dependencies.
- Escape hatch: set `CLAWDBOT_ALLOW_MULTI_TELEGRAM_POLL=1` to disable the poll lock.

Tests:
- `pnpm vitest run src/telegram/update-offset-store.test.ts src/telegram/poll-lock.test.ts`
