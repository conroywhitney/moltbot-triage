## Description

## Problem
`clawdbot cron list` crashes when a cron job uses `id` instead of `jobId`.

## Fix
Added defensive property access to handle both `jobId` and `id` fields.

## Testing
- Build passes
- Linter clean

Fixes #4373

CI failures are all **pre-existing on main** — none caused by this PR:
- `install-smoke` — Docker smoke test infra issue
- `format` — `src/commands/onboard-helpers.ts` formatting (exists on main)
- `test` — `src/config/paths.test.ts:52` expects length 1 but gets 16 (exists on main)
