## Description

## AI-Assisted PR

**AI assistance**: This PR was created with assistance from DeepSeek V3 model.

### Problem
- Issue #7176: TypeError in `sessions_spawn` when `requesterSessionKey` is undefined
- Error occurs at `dist/agents/subagent-announce.js:97` when calling `loadRequesterSessionEntry(undefined)`

### Solution
1. **`loadRequesterSessionEntry()`**: Accept `string | undefined` type, add undefined check
2. **`resolveRequesterStoreKey()`**: Return `string | undefined` to match usage
3. **`maybeQueueSubagentAnnounce()`**: Add null checks for `canonicalKey` and `entry`
4. **`runSubagentAnnounceFlow()`**: Make `requesterSessionKey` parameter optional
5. **Warning log**: Add "No requesterSessionKey provided, skipping announcement" log
6. **Defensive programming**: Add checks before `callGateway()` invocation

### Testing
- **Lightly tested**:
  - ✅ TypeScript type check passes
  - ✅ Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)
  - ✅ Unit tests pass (9 tests)
  - ⚠️ Integration testing with actual OpenClaw instance needed

### Code Understanding Confirmation
✅ I understand what the code does and have reviewed all changes. The fix uses defensive programming to safely handle undefined values while preserving existing logic.

### AI Prompt Summary
1. "Analyze issue #7176"
2. "Write bug fix code"
3. "Set up testing environment"
4. "Check PR creation guidelines"

### Notes
- Uses defensive programming approach for type safety
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Adds warning logs for debugging visibility
- Follows OpenClaw's AI-assisted PR guidelines

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR makes the subagent announcement flow tolerant of a missing `requesterSessionKey` (the root cause of #7176). It widens `requesterSessionKey`/canonical-key handling to `string | undefined`, adds early returns in `loadRequesterSessionEntry()`/`maybeQueueSubagentAnnounce()`, and guards the `callGateway()` invocation so the announce message is skipped (with a log) when no requester session is available.

The changes are localized to `src/agents/subagent-announce.ts` and mainly add defensive checks around session-store lookups and gateway calls to prevent a `TypeError` when `requesterSessionKey` is undefined.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; changes are small, localized, and mainly add guards for undefined values.
- The diff primarily adds early returns/null checks and gates a gateway call on `requesterSessionKey`, which directly addresses the reported crash path. Main remaining concern is the logging severity change (`warn` → `log`), which is behavior/observability-affecting but not functionally risky.
