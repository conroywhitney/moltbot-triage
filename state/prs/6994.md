## Description

Updated the installation guide on a Hetzner VPS.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the Hetzner VPS install guide to include an optional Hetzner `hcloud` CLI provisioning flow, expands the docker-compose example (defaults, bridge port mapping, and a separate CLI service), and adds a first-run configuration section using the CLI container before validating access via an SSH tunnel.

Main thing to double-check is that the `hcloud` commands and configuration steps match the intended behavior (server/context naming and which gateway settings are actually being set), since these docs are likely to be copy/pasted verbatim by new users.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; the main risk is small copy/paste correctness issues in the new command examples.
- Changes are documentation-only and mostly additive, but there are a couple of places where command snippets appear inconsistent with earlier steps (hcloud server vs context naming, and the stated intent of a config command vs what it sets), which would directly impact readers following the guide.
