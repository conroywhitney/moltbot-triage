## Description

## Summary

Wire up signal-cli's `sendPollCreate` to the message tool, enabling poll creation in Signal chats and groups.

### Changes
- Add `sendPollSignal()` function in `src/signal/send.ts`
- Add `sendPoll` method to signal outbound adapter
- **Add "poll" to Signal actions list** so agents can discover and use it
- **Fix direct delivery support** - polls now route directly via signal-cli instead of gateway
- **Fix case sensitivity bug** - Signal group IDs (base64-encoded) are now preserved with correct case
- Support 2-12 options, single or multi-select

## Usage

```typescript
message({
  action: "poll",
  to: "group:GROUP_ID",
  pollQuestion: "What should we have for dinner?",
  pollOption: ["Pizza", "Tacos", "Sushi"],
  pollMulti: true
})
```

## Testing

- [x] Lint passes
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Tested locally with signal-cli daemon
- [x] Verified group ID case sensitivity preserved
- [x] Verified direct delivery works (bypasses gateway)

## Notes

- AI-assisted (Claude) - code reviewed and tested by human
- signal-cli has supported polls since 0.11.0, this just wires it up to Moltbot's message tool
- Group IDs are base64-encoded and CASE-SENSITIVE - previous code incorrectly lowercased them
