## Description

## Summary

Adds a guide for connecting reMarkable tablets to Clawdbot via Tailscale SSH.

## Contents

- Tailscale installation on reMarkable (userspace networking — required since the reMarkable kernel lacks TUN)
- Systemd service for persistence across reboots
- SSH client configuration
- Document management commands (upload PDFs/EPUBs, list, delete)
- Troubleshooting section for common issues

## Testing

Tested on reMarkable 2, OS 3.24.0.149 with Tailscale 1.94.1.
