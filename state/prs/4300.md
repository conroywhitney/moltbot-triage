## Description

### What
Some OpenAI-compatible clients crash or throw when the SSE stream ends without a terminal `chat.completion.chunk` containing `finish_reason`.

### Fix
- Emit a final `chat.completion.chunk` with `finish_reason: "stop"` (and empty `delta`) before sending `data: [DONE]`.
- Keep content-part parsing compatible with both `{ type: "input_text", input_text: "..." }` and older `{ type: "input_text", text: "..." }` shapes.

### Tests
- `pnpm vitest run --config vitest.e2e.config.ts src/gateway/openai-http.e2e.test.ts`

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` SSE streaming implementation to avoid client crashes on stream termination.

- Adds a helper to emit a terminal `chat.completion.chunk` (with `finish_reason`) immediately before `data: [DONE]`.
- Refactors stream shutdown into a shared `endStream()` path used for lifecycle end/error and the `finally` cleanup.
- Updates content-part parsing to accept both `{type: "input_text", input_text: "..."}` and the older `{type: "input_text", text: "..."}` shapes.

Overall this fits the existing gateway approach: it continues to proxy agent events into OpenAI-style chunks while keeping request parsing permissive for multiple client payload formats.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge and addresses a real interoperability issue, with a couple of small cleanup/semantics nits.
- The change is localized to SSE termination behavior and request content parsing, with minimal surface area. The new `endStream()` reduces duplicated shutdown logic and should prevent premature `[DONE]` without a terminal chunk. Remaining concerns are: listener cleanup (`req.on('close')`) and distinguishing normal vs error termination in the terminal chunk semantics.
