## Description

## Summary
- Update `/model` docs to reflect summary view and alias/provider syntax
- Remove numbered picker and `/model <#>` references
- Add `/models` and `/models <provider>` guidance

## Why
PR #1398 (Jan 21, 2026) removed numeric model selection from chat, but the docs were never updated. Users see `/model 3` in docs but get "Numeric model selection is not supported in chat" when they try it.

## Files Changed
- `docs/concepts/models.md`
- `docs/tools/slash-commands.md`
- `docs/help/faq.md`

## Testing
- [x] Docs-only change, no code testing needed
- [x] Verified examples match current `/model` behavior

## AI Disclosure 🤖
This PR was drafted with Claude (Opus 4.5) assistance. The changes are straightforward docs updates that I understand and have verified against the actual code behavior.
