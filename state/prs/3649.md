## Description

## Summary
- Update `/model` docs to reflect summary view and alias/provider syntax
- Remove numbered picker and `/model <#>` references
- Add `/models` and `/models <provider>` guidance

## Why
PR #1398 (Jan 21, 2026) removed numeric model selection from chat, but the docs were never updated. Users see `/model 3` in docs but get "Numeric model selection is not supported in chat" when they try it.

## Files Changed
- `docs/concepts/models.md`
- `docs/tools/slash-commands.md`
- `docs/help/faq.md`

## Testing
- [x] Docs-only change, no code testing needed
- [x] Verified examples match current `/model` behavior

## AI Disclosure 🤖
This PR was drafted with Claude (Opus 4.5) assistance. The changes are straightforward docs updates that I understand and have verified against the actual code behavior.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Docs update aligns model-selection guidance with current chat behavior: removes numeric `/model <#>` examples, documents `/model` summary + `provider/model` and alias usage, and introduces `/models` / `/models <provider>` discovery guidance.

Main inconsistency spotted: the slash-command list still claims `/models` is an alias of `/model`, which conflicts with the new `/models` semantics.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk, but has a couple doc inconsistencies that should be corrected.
- Docs-only changes and the intent is clear, but there are conflicting statements about `/models` (alias vs distinct command) and some leftover `/model list` references that could mislead users.
- docs/tools/slash-commands.md (command list entry) and docs/help/faq.md (remaining `/model list` references).

The command list currently says ``/model <name>`` is an alias of ``/models`` (and also ``/<alias>``). This PR adds separate documentation for `/models` as its own command, so this line is now misleading/incorrect if `/models` is meant to list providers/models rather than act as `/model`.

If `/models` is now distinct, this should be updated (and any `/<alias>` behavior clarified elsewhere).

**`docs/help/faq.md`**
This section still refers to selecting from ``/model list`` (and later also ``/model list`` in chat). After removing numeric picker/list references elsewhere, consider updating this to the new `/models` flow (or confirm `/model list` still exists) so users aren’t sent to a removed/deprecated command.

<sub>Note: If this suggestion doesn't match your team's coding style, reply to this and let me know. I'll remember it for next time!</sub>
