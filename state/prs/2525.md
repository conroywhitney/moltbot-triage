## Description

## Problem

Users who want Clawdbot to control their system browser face three friction points:

1. **Manual extension installation** — Must enable Chrome Developer Mode, run `clawdbot browser extension install`, navigate to `chrome://extensions`, click "Load unpacked", and select the directory
2. **"Browser controlled externally" banner** — Chrome displays an intrusive yellow banner warning that the browser is being controlled by automated software
3. **Bot detection via `navigator.webdriver`** — When Chrome is controlled via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol), it sets `navigator.webdriver = true`. Websites check this flag to detect automated browsing, triggering CAPTCHAs, blocks, or degraded experiences.

## Solution

[BrowserOS](https://browseros.com) is an open-source Chromium fork purpose-built for AI automation that resolves all three issues:

| Issue | Chrome | BrowserOS |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Extension install** | Manual 5-step process: enable Developer Mode → run CLI command → open `chrome://extensions` → "Load unpacked" → select folder | **Auto-installed**: BrowserOS has native support to pre-install the Clawdbot extension automatically when the user enables the feature flag in settings |
| **"Controlled externally" banner** | Always displayed when CDP is active — cannot be disabled | **Removed**: BrowserOS patches Chromium to suppress this banner entirely |
| **`navigator.webdriver` flag** | Set to `true` when automated — websites use `if (navigator.webdriver)` to detect bots and block/CAPTCHA | **Disabled**: BrowserOS patches Chromium so `navigator.webdriver` returns `false`, making automated sessions indistinguishable from normal browsing |

## CLI Usage

You can also enable Clawdbot support via command line flags:

```bash
/Applications/BrowserOS.app/Contents/MacOS/BrowserOS --enable-features=kBrowserOsClawdbot
```
