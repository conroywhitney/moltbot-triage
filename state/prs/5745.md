## Description

grammY's getUpdates timeout error message contains 'timed out' but the recovery check only matched 'timeout'. This caused the polling loop to exit without retrying when long-polling timed out.

Added 'timed out' to RECOVERABLE_MESSAGE_SNIPPETS so these errors are properly recognized and the polling loop retries.

**Problem:**
- Telegram long-polling times out after ~8 minutes
- grammY throws: `Request to 'getUpdates' timed out after 500 seconds`
- Error contains 'timed out' but recovery only checked for 'timeout'
- Polling loop exits and never restarts

**Fix:**
- Added 'timed out' to RECOVERABLE_MESSAGE_SNIPPETS
- Added test case for grammY timeout error

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates Telegram network error recovery detection to treat grammY long-polling timeouts as recoverable by adding the message snippet `"timed out"` to `RECOVERABLE_MESSAGE_SNIPPETS`, and adds a corresponding Vitest case to ensure `Request to 'getUpdates' timed out after 500 seconds` is recognized in polling context.

The change fits into the existing `isRecoverableTelegramNetworkError` flow in `src/telegram/network-errors.ts`, which classifies errors based on codes, names, and (for non-`send` contexts) message snippet matching across nested `cause`/`reason`/`errors` candidates.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Changes are narrowly scoped to broadening a polling-context message snippet match and adding a unit test; no control flow changes beyond improving classification of an already-handled timeout scenario.
- No files require special attention
