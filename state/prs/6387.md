## Description

Mistral provider setup wasn't documented. Added provider page with CLI auth command and config examples.

Changes:
- New provider page at `docs/providers/mistral.md`
- Added Mistral to provider index
- Added navigation and redirects in docs.json

Fixes #6170

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds first-party documentation for the Mistral provider, wires it into the providers index, and updates `docs/docs.json` navigation/redirects so `/mistral` routes to `/providers/mistral`.

Overall the changes fit the existing Mintlify docs structure (provider pages under `docs/providers/*` and discoverable via `docs/providers/index.md`). The main things to double-check are that the CLI auth command shown on the new page reflects an actually-supported flow, and that the config example format matches what OpenClaw expects users to paste.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low-risk and primarily documentation/navigation changes.
- Changes are limited to docs content and Mintlify navigation/redirect configuration; the only meaningful risk is user confusion if the documented CLI auth command or config format doesn’t match actual supported behavior.
- docs/providers/mistral.md (verify command/config accuracy)

[P2] Provider catalog line now lists Mistral but no longer matches intent

This sentence says the "full provider catalog" includes "xAI, Groq, Mistral, etc.", but this page is itself the provider index and now has a dedicated Mistral entry above. Consider removing Mistral from this parenthetical (or rewording) to avoid implying Mistral is only in the "full catalog"/advanced page.

Hey @steipete, the format check is failing but it's not from my changes - looks like there are pre-existing format issues in main (telegram.md, model-providers.md, moonshot.md, onboarding.md, control-ui.md, SKILL.md).

Could you help fix those or let me know if I should include the format fixes in this PR?
