## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new Chinese-language `GIT_SYNC_GUIDE.md` describing how to set up `origin`/`upstream` remotes for a fork, keep `main` in sync with upstream, and maintain a personal changes branch.

The guide is straightforward and should be useful for contributors who maintain local tweaks, but a couple of the shell snippets are easy to mis-copy/paste (commented-out `git rebase` and merge-vs-rebase ordering) and there’s one environment-specific absolute path example that would be better as a generic placeholder.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; it only adds documentation, with a few small correctness/usability issues in command examples.
- Changes are limited to a single new markdown doc. The main concerns are copy/paste correctness in shell snippets and one environment-specific path that could confuse readers; no code behavior changes.
- GIT_SYNC_GUIDE.md (command snippet correctness and portability)
