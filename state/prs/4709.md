## Description

## Summary

The LaunchAgent plist was missing user bin directories on macOS, causing skills that depend on binaries installed via user package managers (volta, pnpm, bun, cargo, etc.) to show as 'blocked' in the UI.

## Root Cause

The function `resolveLinuxUserBinDirs` already had all the logic to resolve user bin directories, but it was only being called for Linux:

```typescript
// Before (bug):
const linuxUserDirs =
  platform === "linux" ? resolveLinuxUserBinDirs(options.home, options.env) : [];
```

## Changes

- Rename `resolveLinuxUserBinDirs` → `resolvePosixUserBinDirs` (more accurate name)
- Apply user bin dir resolution for both `linux` and `darwin` platforms
- Add macOS-specific pnpm path (`~/Library/pnpm`)
- Add cargo bin path (`~/.cargo/bin`)

## After

```typescript
// After (fixed):
const posixUserDirs =
  platform === "linux" || platform === "darwin"
    ? resolvePosixUserBinDirs(options.home, options.env)
    : [];
```

## Testing

1. Run `clawdbot gateway install` on macOS
2. Check `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawdbot.gateway.plist`
3. Verify PATH includes user bin dirs (volta, pnpm, bun, etc.)
4. Confirm skills using those binaries show as 'ready' instead of 'blocked'

## Pull request overview

Updates the daemon’s “minimal PATH” construction so macOS LaunchAgents include common user-level bin directories, preventing skills that rely on user-installed tooling (pnpm/volta/bun/cargo, etc.) from being flagged as blocked.

**Changes:**
- Rename `resolveLinuxUserBinDirs` to `resolvePosixUserBinDirs`.
- Apply user bin dir resolution to both `linux` and `darwin`.
- Add pnpm (macOS) and cargo bin directories to the resolved PATH parts.
