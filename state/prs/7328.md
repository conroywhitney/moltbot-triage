## Description

Integracion de varios modelos y actualizacion de nuevos en distintas actividades agenticas, para chutes AI.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a Chutes.ai integration path across the auth chooser/onboarding flow, plus a new `openclaw chutes models` CLI command and implicit provider/model discovery in `models-config.providers`.

Key concerns are around how OAuth-only users are handled in implicit provider resolution: the code sets a placeholder `apiKey` and still attempts discovery with an empty bearer token, and it’s unclear that the OAuth profile lookup is using the correct provider id. Separately, the new CLI command is described as model discovery but currently only ensures a models.json file exists, which won’t refresh any Chutes model list.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR has some functional mismatches that could confuse users and break OAuth-only Chutes usage.
- Most changes are straightforward wiring for Chutes auth and a new CLI command, but the implicit provider resolution sets an API key placeholder for OAuth profiles and attempts model discovery with an empty bearer token, and the `chutes models` command doesn’t actually perform the described discovery. These are likely to be hit by real users and should be addressed before merging.
- src/agents/models-config.providers.ts, src/cli/program/register.chutes.ts, src/commands/chutes-oauth.ts
