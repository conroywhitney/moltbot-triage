## Description

### Changes Made
This PR updates the `docker-compose.yml` to fix deployment issues when using container orchestration platforms like Coolify.

### What was fixed:
1. **Added build context** - Added `build: .` to both services to enable building from source instead of pulling non-existent images
2. **Updated volume paths** - Changed config directory mount from `/home/node/.clawdbot` to `/home/node/.moltbot` to match the application's current directory structure and prevent "EBUSY" errors

### Technical Details
- Previously, the compose file tried to pull `moltbot:local` from a registry, which doesn't exist
- The volume mount was pointing to the legacy `.clawdbot` directory while the app migrated to `.moltbot`
- These changes allow the application to build and run correctly in containerized environments

### Testing
- [x] Docker Compose builds successfully
- [x] Containers start without path-related errors
- [x] Volume mounts work correctly

### Breaking Changes
None - this is a fix for existing functionality

### Related Issues
Fixes deployment errors:
- `pull access denied for moltbot` 
- `EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rename '/home/node/.clawdbot'`
```

## Comment ( initial comment):
```
This PR makes the Docker Compose configuration compatible with deployment platforms that build from Git repositories. The main issue was trying to pull a local-only image instead of building from source.
