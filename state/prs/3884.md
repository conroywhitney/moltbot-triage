## Description

## Summary

Upgrade GitHub Actions to their latest versions to ensure compatibility with Node 24, as Node 20 will reach end-of-life in April 2026.

## Changes

## Context

Per [GitHub's announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-19-deprecation-of-node-20-on-github-actions-runners/), Node 20 is being deprecated and runners will begin using Node 24 by default starting March 4th, 2026.

### Why this matters

- **Node 20 EOL**: April 2026
- **Node 24 default**: March 4th, 2026
- **Action**: Update to latest action versions that support Node 24

### Security Note

Actions that were previously pinned to commit SHAs remain pinned to SHAs (updated to the latest release SHA) to maintain the security benefits of immutable references.

### Testing

These changes only affect CI/CD workflow configurations and should not impact application functionality. The workflows should be tested by running them on a branch before merging.
