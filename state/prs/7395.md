## Description

## Summary

Fixes #7153

When the LLM wraps a URL in markdown formatting like `**https://example.com**`, WhatsApp includes the `**` characters in the tappable URL, breaking the link.

## Solution

Strip bold/italic markers (`**`, `*`, `__`, `_`) that immediately surround a URL pattern before sending on WhatsApp.

## Changes

- Add `stripMarkdownFromUrls()` function in `src/whatsapp/strip-url-markdown.ts`
- Add 11 unit tests covering all markdown patterns
- Integrate into `sendMessageWhatsApp()` after markdown table conversion

## Examples

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `Check **https://example.com**` | `Check https://example.com` |
| `Visit *https://foo.bar/path*` | `Visit https://foo.bar/path` |
| `See __https://a.com__ and _https://b.com_` | `See https://a.com and https://b.com` |

Non-URL bold/italic text is preserved:
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `This is **bold** text` | `This is **bold** text` |

## Testing

- ✅ 11/11 unit tests pass
- ✅ Lint passes

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a small WhatsApp-specific text normalization step that strips surrounding markdown emphasis markers (`**`, `*`, `__`, `_`) when they directly wrap a URL, preventing WhatsApp from including the markers in the tappable link. The new helper lives in `src/whatsapp/strip-url-markdown.ts`, has dedicated Vitest coverage, and is applied in `sendMessageWhatsApp()` in `src/web/outbound.ts` after markdown table conversion.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; changes are localized and covered by unit tests.
- The change is a straightforward pure function plus a single call site. Main remaining risk is correctness of the URL regex across real-world URLs (e.g., parentheses) and ensuring behavior is covered by an integration-level outbound test.
- src/whatsapp/strip-url-markdown.ts (URL regex edge cases)
