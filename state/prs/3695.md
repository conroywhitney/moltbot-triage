## Description

## Summary

Fixes #3469

The TUI `/model` command was treating all arguments as model names, causing `/model status` to fail with "model not allowed: anthropic/status".

### Changes
- `src/tui/tui-command-handlers.ts`: Check for reserved keywords "status" and "list" before attempting to set model
  - `/model status` now displays current model info
  - `/model list` now opens model selector (same as `/model`)

### Why this fix
The message channel correctly handles these reserved keywords in `directive-handling.model.ts`. This fix aligns TUI behavior with the established pattern.

## Test plan
- [ ] CI tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Manual: `/model status` shows current model
- [ ] Manual: `/model list` opens selector

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the TUI `/model` command handler to treat `status` and `list` as reserved arguments instead of attempting to set them as a model name. As a result, `/model list` opens the model selector (same as `/model`), and `/model status` prints the currently selected provider/model, avoiding the prior `model not allowed: anthropic/status` failure.

The change is localized to `src/tui/tui-command-handlers.ts` and aligns the TUI command parsing with the message-channel directive handling that already treats `status`/`list` specially.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with low risk; it’s a small, localized behavioral fix.
- Change is confined to a single switch case in the TUI command handler and doesn’t affect underlying model selection APIs. Main risk is UX inconsistency: the new `/model status` output is much less detailed than other surfaces’ `/model status`, which could surprise users but won’t break functionality.
