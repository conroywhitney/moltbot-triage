## Description

## Summary

Fixes #3469

The TUI `/model` command was treating all arguments as model names, causing `/model status` to fail with "model not allowed: anthropic/status".

### Changes
- `src/tui/tui-command-handlers.ts`: Check for reserved keywords "status" and "list" before attempting to set model
  - `/model status` now displays current model info
  - `/model list` now opens model selector (same as `/model`)

### Why this fix
The message channel correctly handles these reserved keywords in `directive-handling.model.ts`. This fix aligns TUI behavior with the established pattern.

## Test plan
- [ ] CI tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Manual: `/model status` shows current model
- [ ] Manual: `/model list` opens selector
