## Description

Re-submission of ghosted PR #5657. Prevents doctor --fix from hardcoding resolved secrets.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR threads an additional `template` (config-with-placeholders) through config snapshot/read paths and uses it when writing configs during `doctor --fix` and `security fix`, so `${VAR}` placeholders in the on-disk config are preserved even though runtime uses substituted secrets.

Key changes:
- `ConfigFileSnapshot` now includes both `config` (substituted) and `template` (placeholders preserved).
- `writeConfigFile` accepts an optional `template` and runs `restoreConfigEnvVars` to reinsert placeholders on write.
- `doctor` and `fixSecurityFootguns` now pass the snapshot template on write; new tests cover placeholder preservation.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is due to a likely broken escape-path in env var substitution logic that can crash or corrupt output.
- Most changes are straightforward plumbing to pass a placeholder-preserving template through snapshot/write paths, but the `$${VAR}` escape handling in `substituteString` appears to generate an invalid template-literal string (and/or tries to evaluate an undefined identifier), which is on a core config parsing path.
- src/config/env-substitution.ts (escape handling), src/config/io.ts (template/config separation)

**`src/config/env-substitution.ts`**
[P0] Escaped placeholder branch appears to emit invalid template-literal syntax

In `substituteString`, the `$${VAR}` escape path pushes `` `\${${name}}` `` (line 70), which parses as a template literal with an embedded `${name}` expression (i.e., it tries to evaluate a variable named by `name`), rather than the intended literal string `${VAR}`. This will either fail typecheck/runtime (ReferenceError) or output the wrong string.

```suggestion
          chunks.push(`\${${name}}`);
```
(Should produce the literal `${VAR}`; e.g. `chunks.push(`\${${name}}`)` is currently not doing that.)

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
