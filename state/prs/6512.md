## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts container startup to run the gateway in a platform-friendly way (binding and allowing unconfigured runs) and adds a simple HTTP health check endpoint (`/health` and `/healthz`) in the gateway HTTP server.

The changes touch runtime entrypoints (Docker CMD) and request routing in `createGatewayHttpServer`, which sits in front of hooks/tools/slack/openai/control UI handlers and is an appropriate place to add a lightweight health probe.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is probably safe to merge, but has a couple deployment-critical edge cases around port/bind behavior and health check matching.
- Changes are small and localized, but Docker CMD behavior is easy to get subtly wrong on PaaS (platform port wiring and bind interface), and the health endpoint currently misses common URL variants (query strings/trailing slash).
- Dockerfile, src/gateway/server-http.ts
