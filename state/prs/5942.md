## Description

This PR fixes Signal group messaging target normalization.

Problem:
- Group IDs are often base64/case-sensitive.
- The target normalizer lowercased `group:<id>` which broke routing and caused `Group not found` errors.

Change:
- Preserve group id casing while still matching the `group:` prefix case-insensitively.
- Add a unit test to ensure group ids are not lowercased.

Testing:
- `pnpm test --filter ./src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.test.ts` (vitest suite passed locally; ran via test-parallel).

AI-assisted: yes (implemented with assistance; verified with local tests).

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates Signal messaging target normalization so that `group:<id>` targets preserve the original group ID casing (while still matching the `group:` prefix case-insensitively), preventing case-sensitive/base64 group IDs from being corrupted during normalization. A Vitest unit test was added to assert that group IDs are not lowercased for both `signal:group:<id>` and `group:<id>` inputs.

The change is localized to the Signal normalize plugin (`src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.ts`), which standardizes target strings used for routing; preserving casing for group IDs aligns behavior with Signal’s case-sensitive identifiers while leaving username/UUID normalization behavior unchanged.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is small, well-scoped, and matches the described bug: it avoids lowercasing the group ID while still detecting the `group:` prefix case-insensitively. Existing normalization behavior for usernames/UUIDs remains unchanged, and a focused unit test covers the regression scenario.
- No files require special attention
