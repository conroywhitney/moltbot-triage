## Description

…g pipeline

Fixes #2954

The configuration setting tools.media.image.maxBytes was defined but not wired through the image sanitization pipeline. This resulted in hardcoded constants being used instead of the user-configured value.

Changes:
- Modified sanitizeSessionMessagesImages() to accept maxBytes in options
- Modified sanitizeSessionHistory() to accept and pass maxBytes parameter
- Updated attempt.ts to pass config value through the sanitization chain
- All sanitizeContentBlocksImages() calls now receive the configured maxBytes

This ensures that when users configure a custom image size limit, it is actually used throughout the image processing pipeline instead of being ignored.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR wires the `tools.media.image.maxBytes` configuration through the Pi embedded image handling pipeline so the configured limit is applied consistently (session history sanitization via `sanitizeSessionHistory()` → `sanitizeSessionMessagesImages()` → `sanitizeContentBlocksImages()`, and prompt image loading via `detectAndLoadPromptImages()`).

Net effect: oversized base64 images and auto-loaded prompt images should now be resized/dropped based on user configuration instead of relying only on hardcoded defaults.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge, but there are a couple of correctness/scope concerns worth addressing first.
- The maxBytes wiring itself is straightforward and matches existing sanitizer APIs, but passing raw config values through can create surprising behavior for invalid/non-positive values (effectively dropping all images). Also, the changelog entry appears unrelated to the PR’s described change, suggesting scope creep or an accidental addition.

**`src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts`**
[P0] `tools.media.image.maxBytes` is passed through as-is (possibly `0`/negative), but downstream sanitizers clamp `maxBytes` with `Math.max(..., 1)` (`src/agents/tool-images.ts:142-144`). That means a misconfigured `maxBytes: 0` would silently become a 1-byte limit and cause all images to be dropped/rewritten, which is likely not what users intend (they usually mean “unset/disable”). Consider normalizing/validating the config at the boundary (e.g., treat non-positive as undefined) before passing it to `sanitizeSessionHistory()`/`detectAndLoadPromptImages()`.

Also affects `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts:747` and any other call sites passing config directly.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
