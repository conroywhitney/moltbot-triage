## Description

**What:** Quote the pnpm path on Windows when it contains spaces (e.g. `C:\Program Files\...`), so `pnpm ui:build` no longer fails with `'C:\Program' is not recognized`.

**Why:** `scripts/ui.js` uses `which("pnpm")` and passes the path to `spawn` with `shell: true`; the shell was splitting the path on the space.

**How:** Wrap `runner.cmd` in double quotes when `process.platform === "win32"` and the path includes a space.
