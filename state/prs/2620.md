## Description

## Summary

Adds documentation for [Clauditor](https://github.com/apollostreetcompany/clauditor), a tamper-resistant audit watchdog for Clawdbot VPS deployments.

## Changes

- **New doc:** `docs/security/clauditor.md` — Full documentation for Clauditor (installation, usage, security model)
- **Updated:** `docs/vps.md` — Added "Hardening your VPS" section referencing SSH hardening, fail2ban, and Clauditor

## Why

When running Clawdbot on a production VPS with access to sensitive data, users should have visibility into agent activity. Clauditor provides:

- HMAC hash-chained tamper-evident logs
- Exec monitoring and exfiltration detection
- Independent audit trail that survives agent compromise

This is especially relevant for users giving agents elevated permissions or access to credentials.
