## Description

## Summary

Fixes #3413

Adds a Delete button (🗑) to the Chat tab, providing quick access to delete sessions without navigating to the Sessions tab.

## Features

- **Delete button (🗑)**: Compact icon button next to Stop/New session
  - Disabled during generation (same as New session)
  - **Disabled for main session** (cannot delete main)
- **Native confirmation**: Uses browser `confirm()` dialog on click — no custom modal
- **After deletion**: Automatically switches to main session, refreshes chat history
- **Same behavior as Sessions tab**: Archives transcript (does not permanently delete)

## Mobile layout

- Input field stacked **above** action buttons (full width)
- Compact button padding (4px 8px), no kbd hints
- Buttons aligned right in a single row

## Changes

- **ui/src/ui/views/chat.ts**: Add `onDelete` prop, 🗑 button with `confirm()`, remove modal overlay
- **ui/src/ui/app-render.ts**: Wire up delete handler, hide for main, switch to main after delete
- **ui/src/styles/components.css**: Mobile responsive layout for compose area

## Notes

Uses the same `deleteSession` controller as the Sessions tab, so behavior is consistent - the session entry is removed from the store and the transcript file is archived (not permanently deleted).
