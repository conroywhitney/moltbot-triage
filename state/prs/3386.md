## Description

## Summary

Fixes #3413

![https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/336f67c2-cfbb-4853-b49e-e1bd02acdd1c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/336f67c2-cfbb-4853-b49e-e1bd02acdd1c)

Adds a Delete button to the Chat tab with confirmation modal, providing quick access to delete sessions without navigating to the Sessions tab.

## Features

- **Delete button**: Added next to Stop/New session button
  - Disabled during generation (same as New session)
  - Red danger styling to indicate destructive action
  - **Hidden for main session** (cannot delete main)
- **Confirmation modal**: 
  - Shows session key being deleted
  - Cancel / Delete buttons
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Enter = Delete, Escape = Cancel
- **After deletion**:
  - Automatically switches to main session
  - Refreshes chat history / session list
- **Same behavior as Sessions tab**: Archives transcript (doesn't permanently delete)

## Changes

- **ui/src/ui/views/chat.ts**: Add delete props, keydown handler, modal overlay, delete button
- **ui/src/ui/app.ts**: Add `chatDeleteConfirm` state
- **ui/src/ui/app-render.ts**: Wire up delete click/confirm/cancel handlers, hide for main, switch to main after delete
- **ui/src/styles/components.css**: Styles for confirmation modal

## Notes

Uses the same `deleteSession` controller as the Sessions tab, so behavior is consistent - the session entry is removed from the store and the transcript file is archived (not permanently deleted).
