## Description

## Summary

- Adds the **raysurfer** skill to the bundled skills directory
- Raysurfer lets AI agents cache and reuse code from prior executions, avoiding redundant code generation by searching a shared cache before writing new code and uploading successful results afterward
- Includes ready-to-run search and upload scripts in Python, Bash, and TypeScript
- Includes full API reference documentation in `references/api-reference.md`

## Files Added

```
skills/raysurfer/
├── SKILL.md                    # Skill definition with workflow instructions
├── references/
│   └── api-reference.md        # Full API docs (search, upload, vote endpoints)
├── search.py                   # Python search script
├── search.sh                   # Bash search script
├── search.ts                   # TypeScript search script

└── upload.ts                   # TypeScript upload script
```

## Test plan

- [ ] Verify skill loads correctly via `openclaw skills list`
- [ ] Test search with `RAYSURFER_API_KEY` set: `/raysurfer parse CSV and plot chart`
- [ ] Test upload flow: `/raysurfer upload`
- [ ] Verify skill works without API key (graceful skip)

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new bundled skill, `skills/raysurfer`, intended to let agents search a hosted cache for prior code and upload successful “execution results” back to the service. It includes the skill definition (`SKILL.md`), API reference docs, and helper scripts in Python/Bash/TypeScript for search and upload.

Overall the additions are straightforward, but a few sharp edges will likely show up in the advertised “works without API key” flow and in the shell scripts’ JSON construction.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge but has a couple of user-facing reliability/security footguns in the helper scripts.
- Changes are additive (new skill + scripts + docs) and don’t touch core runtime, but multiple scripts will currently crash or misbehave when `RAYSURFER_API_KEY` is missing (despite docs/test plan expecting graceful skip), and the Bash scripts build JSON via interpolation which can break on quoted/newline task strings or allow payload injection.
