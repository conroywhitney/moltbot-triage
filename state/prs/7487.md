## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds `CODE_REVIEW.md`, a repo-persistent writeup reviewing five recent security/maintenance commits (b796f6e..411d5fd), summarizing intent, positives, and potential follow-ups per commit.

Since this is documentation (not code changes), the main review focus is on long-term usefulness and clarity for future readers browsing the repo history.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it adds documentation only.
- Changes are limited to adding a new markdown file and do not affect runtime behavior. Remaining concerns are about doc longevity/clarity (stale metadata, language accessibility), not correctness or security.
- CODE_REVIEW.md
