## Description

## Summary

Adds support for customizing the Slack thread status messages shown while processing requests.

## New Config Options

```yaml
channels:
  slack:
    typingStatus: 'is thinking...'
    loadingMessages:
      - 'Consulting the oracle...'
      - 'Crunching the numbers...'
      - 'Pondering deeply...'
```

- **loadingMessages**: `string[]` - Array of messages that rotate randomly during processing. These are passed to Slack's `assistant.threads.setStatus` API which displays them as status updates.
- **typingStatus**: `string` - Custom typing indicator text (default: `is typing...`)

## Motivation

Slack's Assistant API supports `loading_messages` as a way to show variety while the bot is thinking. This makes the experience feel more dynamic and less static than always showing "is typing...".

This was inspired by wanting to customize messages like:
- "Consulting the hexadecimal oracle..."
- "Parsing the cosmos..."
- "Brewing up a response..."

## Changes

- `src/config/types.slack.ts`: Added `loadingMessages` and `typingStatus` to `SlackAccountConfig`
- `src/slack/monitor/context.ts`: Updated context to accept and pass through loading messages
- `src/slack/monitor/message-handler/dispatch.ts`: Use configured status instead of hardcoded string
- `src/slack/monitor/provider.ts`: Extract config values and pass to context
