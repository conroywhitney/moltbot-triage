## Description

## Summary

When a new session is created for a Slack thread, fetch and inject the full thread history as context. This preserves conversation continuity so the bot knows what it previously said in the thread.

## Changes

- Add `resolveSlackThreadHistory()` function to fetch all thread messages via `conversations.replies`
- Add `ThreadHistoryBody` field to context payload
- Use full thread history (instead of just thread starter) when creating new thread sessions
- The history includes both user messages and bot replies with proper role attribution

## Testing

- [ ] New thread session should include previous messages as context
- [ ] Existing thread sessions should continue to work as before
- [ ] Bot should be able to reference its previous replies in a thread

## Config

Works with existing Slack config:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "replyToMode": "all",
      "thread": { "inheritParent": false }
    }
  }
}
```
