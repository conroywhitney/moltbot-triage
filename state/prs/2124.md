## Description

Fixes #2101

## Summary
Adds inline Block Kit buttons for exec approval requests in Slack DMs, mirroring the existing Discord implementation.

## Changes
- Add `SlackExecApprovalConfig` type and Zod schema
- Create `SlackExecApprovalHandler` that:
  - Listens to gateway events for approval requests
  - Sends Block Kit messages with Allow once / Always allow / Deny buttons
  - Updates messages when resolved or expired
  - Uses Slack's `<!date^...>` for localized expiry times
- Skip text forwarder when Slack buttons are enabled (no duplicates)
- Register action handlers in Slack monitor

## Config
```yaml
channels:
  slack:
    execApprovals:
      enabled: true
      approvers: ["U12345678"]
      agentFilter: ["main"]     # optional
      sessionFilter: ["slack"]  # optional
```

One thing I do have to say is how shockingly good this workflow is. I've tried most of the coding agents recently, and nothing has quite compared to just dispatching and collaborating on a project with my own personalized assistant
