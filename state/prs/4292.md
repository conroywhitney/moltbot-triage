## Description

## Summary
Allow `nativeSkills` config to accept an array of skill names instead of just boolean/auto.

## Problem
Telegram has a 100 command limit. With many skills, users hit this limit and get `BOT_COMMANDS_TOO_MUCH` errors.

## Solution
Add support for whitelisting specific skills:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "nativeSkills": ["perplexity-search", "google-workspace", "meeting-notes"]
  }
}
```

This registers only the specified skills as native Telegram commands while keeping all skills functional via chat.

## Changes
- Updated `NativeSkillsSettingSchema` to accept `string[]` in addition to boolean/auto
- Added `NativeSkillsSetting` type
- Added `resolveNativeSkillsSetting()` function that returns `boolean | string[]`
- Updated Telegram bot to filter skills when whitelist is provided

## Testing
- [ ] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] Manual test with whitelist config
