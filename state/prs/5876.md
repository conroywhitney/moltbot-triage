## Description

## Summary

Adds a new convention to the AGENTS.md template encouraging agents to always anchor relative dates to absolute ones when writing to memory files.

## Problem

Relative dates like "tomorrow", "next week", or "yesterday" become meaningless once the day passes. This leads to:
- Stale reminders that keep firing because the agent can't tell if the date has passed
- Confusing memory entries that lose context over time
- Missed events or duplicate alerts

## Solution

Add a `📅 Use Absolute Dates!` section to the Memory conventions in AGENTS.md:

```markdown
- ❌ "Demo is tomorrow"
- ✅ "Demo is tomorrow — Sunday, February 1st"
- ❌ "Meeting next Tuesday"
- ✅ "Meeting next Tuesday, February 4th"
```

## Real-world example

Discovered via a demo reminder that was stored as "Jan 30/31 - date TBC" without year context. The reminder kept firing on Jan 31st because the agent couldn't determine whether the demo had already happened.

## Changes

- `docs/reference/templates/AGENTS.md`: Added "📅 Use Absolute Dates!" section after "📝 Write It Down"

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates `docs/reference/templates/AGENTS.md` by adding a “Use Absolute Dates” convention in the Memory section, encouraging agents to anchor relative-date reminders (e.g., “tomorrow”) to explicit calendar dates. This aligns with the template’s broader goal of making agent memory durable across sessions and avoiding reminders that become ambiguous over time.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s a small documentation-only change with low risk.
- The change is confined to a single docs template and introduces no code/runtime behavior changes. The only meaningful risks are minor documentation clarity/consistency issues (date format examples and heading/anchor stability).
- docs/reference/templates/AGENTS.md
