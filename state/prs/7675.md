## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR wraps `os.networkInterfaces()` in `resolvePrimaryIPv4()` with a `try/catch` and falls back when network interface enumeration fails, preventing crashes during self-presence initialization.

The change lives in `src/infra/system-presence.ts`, which seeds a local “gateway self” presence entry at module init and uses the resolved IPv4 address to populate the `ip` field and display text.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and reduces crash risk, with a small behavioral ambiguity around the `ip` fallback value.
- The change is localized and defensive, but the new fallback path returns a hostname in a function used to populate an `ip` field, which could confuse downstream consumers or UI formatting.
- src/infra/system-presence.ts
