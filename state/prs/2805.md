## Description

## Summary
- Previously, `onToolResult` was not connected in `dispatchReplyFromConfig`, causing verbose tool summaries to not be sent to messaging channels like Telegram
- This adds the missing `onToolResult` handler similar to `onBlockReply`

## Test plan
- [x] Enable verbose mode in Telegram with `/verbose full`
- [x] Send a message that triggers tool calls
- [x] Verify tool result summaries are now visible in the chat
