## Description

## Summary

This PR adds the ability to configure a dedicated model for compaction summarization, separate from the session's primary model. This allows using a fast, cheap model (like Gemini 2 Flash) for generating summaries while keeping expensive models (like Opus) for the main conversation.

## Problem

When compaction occurs, the `compaction-safeguard` extension generates summaries using the **session's current model**. This has several issues:

1. **Cost** - Using Opus/Sonnet for summarization is expensive
2. **Failures** - If the session model has rate limits or context overflow, summarization fails silently and falls back to "Summary unavailable due to context limits"
3. **No flexibility** - Users cannot optimize summarization independently from their main model choice

## Solution

Added a new `compaction.model` config option that specifies a dedicated model for summarization:

{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "compaction": {
        "mode": "safeguard",
        "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash",  // NEW
        "reserveTokensFloor": 20000
      }
    }
  }
}

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a `compaction.model` agent-defaults config option and wires it into the `compaction-safeguard` extension via the session-scoped runtime registry. When set, compaction summarization attempts to use the configured dedicated model (looked up in `ctx.modelRegistry`) and falls back to the session model if the model isn’t found or if the dedicated model lacks an API key.

Key changes:
- `src/config/types.agent-defaults.ts` + `src/config/zod-schema.agent-defaults.ts`: introduce and validate the new `agents.defaults.compaction.model` field.
- `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/extensions.ts`: passes `compaction.model` into `setCompactionSafeguardRuntime`.
- `src/agents/pi-extensions/compaction-safeguard.ts`: resolves the summarization model from runtime, fetches the appropriate API key, and adds fallback behavior.

Main review notes: the new override is silently ignored when the `compaction.model` string is malformed (no `/`), and the schema doesn’t enforce the `provider/modelId` format, so misconfigs can slip through validation and only “fail” at runtime without a clear signal.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; the main risks are around configuration validation and discoverability of misconfiguration.
- Changes are additive and scoped to compaction safeguard model selection with clear fallback to the session model. The primary concern is that malformed `compaction.model` values are silently ignored and the schema doesn’t validate the documented format, which can confuse users but shouldn’t break compaction behavior (it will fall back).
- src/agents/pi-extensions/compaction-safeguard.ts, src/config/zod-schema.agent-defaults.ts
