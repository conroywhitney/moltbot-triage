## Description

## What

Replaces the Windows detection message during onboarding:

**Before:**
```
Windows detected.
WSL2 is strongly recommended; native Windows is untested and more problematic.
```

**After:**
```
Windows detected — Clawdbot runs great on WSL2!
Quick setup: wsl --install (one command, one reboot)
```

Also updates `docs/platforms/windows.md` with the same positive framing.

## Why

The old message reads as discouraging to Windows users. Clawdbot actually runs *great* on WSL2 — the message should reflect that and give users the one command they need to get going, rather than making them feel like they picked the wrong OS.

## Changes
- `src/commands/onboard.ts` — Updated CLI output
- `docs/platforms/windows.md` — Updated docs to match
