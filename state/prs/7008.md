## Description

## Summary

This PR adds support for running OpenClaw natively on Windows 11 without requiring WSL2.

## What's Included

- **WINDOWS_INSTALL_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive installation guide with troubleshooting
- **install-openclaw-windows.ps1** - One-click PowerShell installer
- **openclaw-windows-example.json** - Working example configuration
- **start-openclaw.bat** - Quick-start batch file
- **README.md** - Overview for the Windows docs directory

## Tested On

- Windows 11 22H2
- Node.js v20.x LTS
- OpenClaw v2026.1.29

## Known Issues Documented

1. **Discord Integration** - Module resolution differences on Windows. Workaround: Run `openclaw doctor --fix` before gateway.

2. **Session Directory** - Windows doesn't auto-create sessions directory. Fix included in install script.

3. **Gateway Auth Token** - Token configuration documented.

## Testing Results

- ✅ CLI commands work (`openclaw doctor`, `openclaw status`)
- ✅ Gateway starts successfully
- ✅ Discord bot connects and responds
- ✅ GitHub Copilot model integration works
- ✅ Moltbook skill installation works

## Addresses

Community requests for native Windows support without WSL2 dependency.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a Windows-native docs bundle under `docs/windows/` including an install guide, a PowerShell installer, an example config, and a quick-start batch file for launching the gateway. The intent is to let Windows 11 users run OpenClaw without WSL2, and to document known Windows-specific operational issues (Discord module quirks, missing session directory, gateway token setup).

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge, but it ships an insecure default gateway token in a runnable script and has a couple of confusing docs/config defaults.
- Changes are isolated to documentation and helper scripts, with no core runtime code changes. The main risk is user-facing security posture: the batch file hard-codes a gateway auth token, and the docs/config examples could lead to unintended insecure setups or confusion.
- docs/windows/start-openclaw.bat; docs/windows/WINDOWS_INSTALL_GUIDE.md; docs/windows/openclaw-windows-example.json
