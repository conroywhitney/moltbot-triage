## Description

## Summary

Adds modules to detect and decode obfuscated prompt injection attacks.

**Part 2 of 3** from Operation CLAW FORTRESS security hardening (split from #5863 for easier review).

## New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/security/obfuscation-decoder.ts` | Core decoding functions |
| `src/security/input-preprocessing.ts` | Encoding detection API |
| `src/security/input-preprocessing.test.ts` | Regression tests |

## Obfuscation Techniques Decoded

| Technique | Example | Decoded |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Base64 | `aWdub3JlIHByZXZpb3Vz` | "ignore previous" |
| ROT13 | `vtaber cerivbhf` | "ignore previous" |
| Leetspeak | `5y5t3m pr0mpt` | "system prompt" |
| Pig Latin | `omptpray eviouspray` | "prompt previous" |
| Syllables | `ig-nore pre-vi-ous` | "ignore previous" |
| Homoglyphs | `sуstеm` (Cyrillic) | "system" |

## ZeroLeaks Findings Addressed

- Encoding bypass attacks (Base64, ROT13)
- Leetspeak obfuscation
- Unicode homoglyph substitution

## Test Plan

- [x] Unit tests for all decoders
- [x] Regression tests with ZeroLeaks payloads
- [ ] Integration testing

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a small security-focused preprocessing layer under `src/security/` to detect and decode obfuscated prompt-injection content (Base64/ROT13/reversed, plus deobfuscation helpers for leetspeak, syllable splitting, and homoglyph normalization). Unit tests cover the new decoders and some “ZeroLeaks” regression payloads.

Main things to double-check before merging: the use of global regexes with `.test()` in `detectEncodedContent` can make detection flaky due to `lastIndex` mutation, and `reverseText` relies on `Array.prototype.toReversed()` which may not exist in all supported runtimes.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is close to safe to merge, but it has a couple of correctness/runtime hazards that could make detection flaky or crash in some environments.
- The overall change is isolated and test-covered, but `RegExp.test` is used on `/.../g` regexes (which mutates `lastIndex` and can lead to intermittent false negatives), and `reverseText` uses `toReversed()` which may not exist depending on the Node/runtime version used in CI or production.
- src/security/input-preprocessing.ts and src/security/obfuscation-decoder.ts
