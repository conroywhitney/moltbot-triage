## Description

## Summary

- **fix(session):** Normalize tool call blocks for cross-provider compatibility - fixes API validation errors when switching providers mid-session (e.g., Google Antigravity → Anthropic)
- **fix(windows):** Add PowerShell syntax guidance to agent system prompt + fix session-memory hook to use `pathToFileURL` for dynamic imports
- **chore:** Remove deprecated moltbot compatibility package (users have migrated to openclaw)

## Test plan

- [ ] Verify Windows users see improved PowerShell guidance in agent responses
- [ ] Test provider switching mid-session doesn't cause "input: Field required" errors
- [ ] Confirm moltbot package removal doesn't break any existing workflows

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR removes the deprecated `moltbot` compatibility package, adds Windows-focused PowerShell syntax guidance to the agent system prompt, and hardens session history sanitization by normalizing provider-specific tool call block shapes (to prevent validation errors when switching providers mid-session). It also updates the session-memory hook to use `pathToFileURL()` for dynamic imports so it works on Windows file paths.

Key areas to double-check are the new tool-call normalization (ensure it produces a single canonical schema with no leftover provider-specific fields) and the session-memory dynamic import path (ensure `llm-slug-generator.js` is always present in the built distribution layout expected by the hook).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR looks generally safe to merge, with a couple of edge-case compatibility concerns worth tightening.
- Most changes are straightforward (package removal, prompt text, Windows URL import fix) and the session sanitization change is localized. The main remaining risk is schema strictness around the new tool-call normalization (leaving provider-specific keys like `input` attached) and assumptions about the built file layout for the dynamic import target.
