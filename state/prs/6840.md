<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the gateway’s `agent.identity.get` handler (`src/gateway/server-methods/agent.ts`) to resolve the assistant identity’s agentId via the configured default agent when the provided `sessionKey` isn’t agent-scoped (e.g., `global`/`main`). Concretely, it replaces `resolveAgentIdFromSessionKey(sessionKey)` with `resolveSessionAgentId({ sessionKey, config: cfg })`, so Control UI identity/name selection aligns with `agents.list[].default` rather than always falling back to the hardcoded `main` default.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Change is localized to identity resolution in a single handler and aligns behavior with existing `resolveSessionAgentId` logic used elsewhere. The only issue spotted is an unused import that could fail lint/CI depending on repo settings.

**`src/gateway/server-methods/agent.ts`**
[P1] `resolveAgentIdFromSessionKey` import is now unused.

In this file you switched `agent.identity.get` to use `resolveSessionAgentId(...)`, but the file still imports `resolveAgentIdFromSessionKey` from `../../config/sessions.js` and doesn’t reference it anymore. With TS/ESLint settings that enforce no-unused-vars/imports, this will fail CI/lint.

Also appears as an unused import in the same import block: `src/gateway/server-methods/agent.ts:7-12`.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

### @JorgeAlan (2026-02-02)

The import is still used in this file (e.g. lines ~195 and ~281 for session handling). So it should not be unused unless those references were removed in a different version. If you’re seeing an unused import, please double‑check that those references are still present; otherwise we can drop the import.
