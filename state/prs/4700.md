## Description

## Summary

Fixes Anthropic API rejection error: `messages.X.content.Y: tool_use ids must be unique`

This issue occurs when:
1. Session transcripts accumulate multiple assistant messages with the same tool_use ID (e.g., from retries or long conversations)
2. Tool IDs contain special characters (spaces, colons) that weren't being sanitized for Anthropic

## Changes

- Add deduplication logic in `repairToolUseResultPairing()` to detect and rename duplicate tool_use IDs in assistant messages (e.g., `call_1` → `call_1_2`)
- Update corresponding toolResult IDs to match the remapped tool_use IDs  
- Enable `sanitizeToolCallIds` for Anthropic provider (previously only Google/Mistral)
- Add tests for deduplication scenarios

## Test plan

- [x] Existing tests pass (`session-transcript-repair.test.ts`)
- [x] New tests added for duplicate ID scenarios
- [x] Verified fix resolves the error in production session with duplicate IDs

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR strengthens transcript sanitization/repair for Anthropic-compatible requests by (1) enabling `sanitizeToolCallIds` for Anthropic in the transcript policy and (2) extending `repairToolUseResultPairing()` to deduplicate duplicate assistant tool_use IDs across a session and remap the corresponding toolResult IDs. Tests were updated/added to cover the new Anthropic sanitize flag and a basic duplicate-ID-across-messages scenario.

The changes fit into the existing transcript hygiene pipeline (`sanitizeSessionHistory` in `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/google.ts`), where messages are first sanitized (including tool call IDs) and then repaired to ensure strict toolCall/toolResult ordering expected by providers like Anthropic.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is close to safe to merge, but has a correctness edge case around duplicate IDs within a single assistant turn that could drop tool results.
- The overall approach (deduplicate IDs + remap toolResult IDs, and enable sanitization for Anthropic) matches the reported provider constraint and is covered by new tests. However, the current remapping uses a Map keyed by the original ID, so duplicates within the same assistant message can collapse to one remapped ID and cause `pushToolResult` to treat later results as duplicates and drop them. That edge case could affect real transcripts if a retry duplicates blocks inside one message.
