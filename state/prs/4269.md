## Description

Add support for the backend tool result image format { type: "image", data: "base64...", mimeType: "image/png" } in the extractImages function.

Previously, Control UI only recognized the Anthropic standard format with a nested source object. This fix allows browser screenshots and other tool-generated images to display correctly in the chat interface.
