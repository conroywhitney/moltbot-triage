## Description

## Summary
Updates `.env.example` from legacy Twilio-only configuration to a comprehensive modern setup guide.

## Changes
- ✨ Added examples for current primary channels: Telegram, Discord, Slack
- ✨ Added examples for AI providers: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google Gemini
- ✨ Added examples for optional services: Brave Search, ElevenLabs
- 📝 Added helpful comments with links to get API keys
- 🗑️ Marked legacy Twilio config as deprecated
- 🎨 Organized into clear sections for better readability

## Motivation
The existing `.env.example` only showed Twilio WhatsApp configuration, which is now deprecated in favor of Baileys. New users need examples for:
- Modern messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack are the most popular)
- AI provider setup (Anthropic/Claude is the recommended primary model)
- Optional features like web search and TTS

This makes onboarding significantly easier by showing all available environment variables with context.

## Testing
- Verified format and structure
- All links to API key sources are valid
- Comments are clear and helpful

## Type
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Bug fix
