## Description

## Summary

Adds Python virtual environment directories and cache folders to the default ignore list for the skills file watcher.

## Problem

I added a skill that used a Python tool, which created a `scripts/.venv` folder containing ~42,000 files. The skills watcher was monitoring all these files, causing file descriptor exhaustion on macOS. This resulted in `EBADF` (spawn) errors that caused **all** exec/shell commands to fail across Moltbot.

## Solution

Added the following patterns to `DEFAULT_SKILLS_WATCH_IGNORED`:

**Python virtual environments and caches:**
- `.venv` / `venv` - Virtual environment directories
- `__pycache__` - Python bytecode cache
- `.mypy_cache` - mypy type checker cache
- `.pytest_cache` - pytest cache

**Build artifacts and caches:**
- `build` - Common build output directory
- `.cache` - Generic cache directory

## Test plan

- [x] Updated existing test to verify all new patterns are correctly ignored
- [x] Verified normal skill files (e.g., `SKILL.md`) are NOT ignored
- [x] Tested locally - confirmed EBADF errors resolved after removing heavy venv from skills folder

This caused my hours of grief trying to work out what I had misconfigured so all bash execution was failing. The agent could talk to me, and run some limited tools, but could not DO anything. `spawn EBADF`

Eventually me and opus worked out it was file exhaustion from the 40k+ files I had in my skills directory causing the file watcher to eat up all the file descriptors because the skill I'd created ran in it's own python venv.
