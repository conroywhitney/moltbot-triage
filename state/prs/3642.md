## Description

Hey! This PR adds support for a 
repository field in skill metadata, making it easier for users to trace skills back to their source code.

## What's Changed

- Added 
repository field to skill metadata types
- Parse repository URL from skill frontmatter
- Display repository link in the web UI (with a nice GitHub icon)
- Include repository in CLI output (moltbot skills list --json and moltbot skills info)
- Added unit tests for the new parsing

## Why

Per #3532, users should be able to see where a skill comes from before installing it. This helps with:
- Auditing what code you're running
- Checking if a skill is actively maintained
- Contributing back to skill repos

## Scope Note

This PR covers the **client-side** changes. The ClawdHub registry and CLI are separate packages, so displaying repository in search results/install prompts would need changes there too.
