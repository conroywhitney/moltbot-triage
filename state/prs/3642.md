## Description

Hey! This PR adds support for a 
repository field in skill metadata, making it easier for users to trace skills back to their source code.

## What's Changed

- Added 
repository field to skill metadata types
- Parse repository URL from skill frontmatter
- Display repository link in the web UI (with a nice GitHub icon)
- Include repository in CLI output (moltbot skills list --json and moltbot skills info)
- Added unit tests for the new parsing

## Why

Per #3532, users should be able to see where a skill comes from before installing it. This helps with:
- Auditing what code you're running
- Checking if a skill is actively maintained
- Contributing back to skill repos

## Scope Note

This PR covers the **client-side** changes. The ClawdHub registry and CLI are separate packages, so displaying repository in search results/install prompts would need changes there too.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a `repository` URL field to skill metadata end-to-end: it’s parsed from skill frontmatter metadata (`moltbot.repository`), carried through skill status aggregation, and surfaced in both CLI outputs (`skills list --json` / `skills info`) and the web UI as a “Source” link with a GitHub icon.

The change fits the existing skill metadata pipeline: frontmatter → `MoltbotSkillMetadata` → `SkillStatusEntry` → consumers (CLI/UI). Tests were added around `resolveMoltbotMetadata` parsing to cover repository extraction.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; changes are mostly additive metadata plumbing with minor UI edge cases.
- No high-risk logic changes were introduced; the main concern is UI behavior around install/missing indicators not accounting for `anyBins`, which can reduce UX correctness but won’t break core functionality.
- ui/src/ui/views/skills.ts (install gating and missing-summary completeness)

[P1] `canInstall` ignores `anyBins` missing state

`canInstall` is currently gated by `skill.missing.bins.length > 0`, but the UI also shows `anyBins` as a possible missing requirement (and the backend tracks `missing.anyBins`). This means skills that are blocked only because `anyBins` are missing won’t show an install button even though an install spec might satisfy that requirement.

This logic likely wants to consider `missing.anyBins` (or more generally “not eligible because of missing binaries”) in addition to `missing.bins`.

Also appears in the `missing` display list in this file (it currently omits `anyBins`).

[P2] Missing summary omits `anyBins`

The UI builds `missing` from `bins/env/config/os` but not `anyBins`, so users won’t see that a skill is blocked because “any of these binaries” are required. Since the backend reports `missing.anyBins`, it should be included for parity with CLI and accurate troubleshooting.
