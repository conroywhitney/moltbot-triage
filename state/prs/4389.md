## Description

## Summary
Fixes #4380 - Slack thread_ts messages were being dropped because the queue drain logic used `typeof === 'number'` to check for thread IDs.

## Problem
Slack thread_ts values are strings (e.g., `'1737766124.329349'`), not numbers. The original code:
```typescript
if (typeof threadId !== 'number') // This fails for Slack string thread IDs
```

This caused valid Slack thread messages to be filtered out incorrectly.

## Solution
Changed three occurrences in `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/drain.ts`:
- Line 43: `typeof threadId !== 'number'` → `threadId == null`
- Line 49: `typeof threadId === 'number'` → `threadId != null`
- Line 75: `typeof originatingThreadId === 'number'` → `originatingThreadId != null`

## Testing
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Existing queue tests pass (8 tests total)
- Change allows string thread IDs while still filtering undefined/null values

## Notes
This is a straightforward type check fix - no behavioral changes for existing numeric thread IDs.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates follow-up queue drain routing so Slack `thread_ts` values (strings like `"1737766124.329349"`) aren’t dropped by `typeof === "number"` checks. In `src/auto-reply/reply/queue/drain.ts`, the cross-channel key derivation and collected-run `originatingThreadId` selection now treat any non-null thread ID (string or number) as present and stringify it into the routing key, aligning with the `originatingThreadId?: string | number` type used across the queue pipeline.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; it’s a small, targeted fix with one edge-case worth confirming.
- The change correctly aligns drain routing with Slack’s string `thread_ts` and the existing `string | number` type. Main risk is minor behavior change if empty-string thread IDs can occur, since the new null-check treats `""` as present in one selection path.
- src/auto-reply/reply/queue/drain.ts (confirm empty-string thread ID cannot occur or should be treated as absent)
