## Description

## Summary
- Updates documentation to recommend `npm install -g moltbot@beta` instead of `moltbot@latest`
- Adds warning notes explaining that `@latest` currently points to v0.1.0 which lacks the CLI binary
- Updates 6 documentation files with the fix

## Problem
The npm `@latest` tag for `moltbot` points to v0.1.0, which:
1. Has no `bin` field in package.json
2. Doesn't expose the `moltbot` CLI command after global install
3. Causes the Windows installer to fail with ENOENT

This affects all platforms, not just Windows, but Windows users are particularly impacted since they can't easily work around it.

## Solution
Update documentation to recommend `@beta` until `@latest` is updated:
```bash
npm install -g moltbot@beta
# instead of
npm install -g moltbot@latest
```

## Files changed
- `README.md` - Main readme install instructions
- `docs/index.md` - Docs homepage quick start
- `docs/install/index.md` - Main install documentation
- `docs/install/installer.md` - Installer script documentation (added warnings)
- `docs/start/getting-started.md` - Getting started guide
- `docs/help/faq.md` - FAQ section

## Test plan
- [x] Documentation changes only - no code changes
- [ ] Verify that `npm install -g moltbot@beta` works correctly

## Note
This is a documentation workaround. The proper fix is to publish the current version to npm with the `@latest` tag. The installer scripts (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`) hosted on molt.bot also need to be updated separately.

Fixes #3787
