<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a `skipDisplayName` flag to session metadata derivation so outbound sends don’t overwrite a session’s `displayName` with the last recipient. The new option is threaded through `deriveGroupSessionPatch`/`deriveSessionMetaPatch`, exposed via `recordSessionMetaFromInbound`, and used by `ensureOutboundSessionEntry` during outbound message routing. A unit test is added to assert `displayName` is omitted when the flag is set, and the changelog notes the fix.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- Changes are tightly scoped to gating `displayName` derivation behind an explicit flag and only applied in the outbound-session entry path; no schema changes and a targeted unit test covers the new behavior. I did not find any functional regressions in the modified call sites.
- No files require special attention
