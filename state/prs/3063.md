## Description

## Summary
Enables horizontal scrolling on the navigation sidebar using the mouse wheel, without requiring Shift+wheel.

## Why
Below 1100px viewport width, the nav switches to a horizontal scrollable layout. For users without a trackpad (Mac) or those working with a mouse, scrolling horizontally currently requires Shift+wheel or dragging, which is not intuitive. This change allows natural mouse wheel scrolling on the horizontal nav bar.

## Changes
- Added wheel event listener in \handleFirstUpdated()\ that converts vertical scroll delta to horizontal scroll when hovering over \.nav
## AI Disclosure
- [x] AI-assisted (Claude Opus on Antigravity)
- [x] Fully tested locally
- [x] I understand what the code does

## Testing
Tested on Windows 11:
- Chrome 144.0.7559.110 (64-bit) 
- Brave 1.86.142 / Chromium 144.0.7559.97 (64-bit) 
- Firefox 147.0.1 

All at <1100px viewport width - horizontal wheel scroll works as expected.
