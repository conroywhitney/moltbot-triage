## Description

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR tweaks `getBearerToken` in `src/gateway/http-utils.ts` to return early when the `Authorization` header is missing/empty (after trimming) rather than defaulting to an empty string, while keeping the existing `Bearer …` prefix parsing.

The change sits in the gateway request parsing helpers used to normalize headers and resolve auth/session routing inputs.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk and narrowly scoped to bearer-token parsing.
- The change is small and localized, with no obvious behavioral regressions for valid headers; main concern is a minor readability/perceived intent issue around the added length check.
- src/gateway/http-utils.ts
