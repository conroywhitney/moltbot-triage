## Description

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbf044cd-0e5a-4cb5-bf6b-fbfad058e5b4" width="300" alt="description">


Makes `/stop` the first command in the Telegram bot menu for quick access when needing to abort a running task.

Currently `/stop` is buried after help, status, tts, etc. — moving it to the top of the command list so it appears first in the bot menu.

**Note:** Telegram clients aggressively cache the bot command menu. After deploying, the new order may not appear until the user deletes and re-opens the chat with the bot.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR reorders the Telegram chat command registry so `/stop` is defined first in `buildChatCommands()`, which should cause it to appear at the top of the bot command menu in Telegram clients. No command behavior changes were introduced; the change is purely the ordering of the `stop` command entry within the static command definition list, and all existing alias/registry assertions remain in place.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change only reorders an existing command definition; it does not alter parsing, behavior, aliases, or registry validation. The file’s internal `assertCommandRegistry()` still runs, so accidental duplication would be caught at runtime/tests.
- No files require special attention

Note: Telegram clients aggressively cache the bot command menu. After deploying, the new order may not appear until the user deletes and re-opens the chat with the bot. Calling `deleteMyCommands` + `setMyCommands` and restarting the Telegram app is not sufficient to refresh the cached order on iOS.
