## Description

## Summary

Fixes two bugs in the compaction/delivery system:

1. **Compaction hooks never invoked**: `runBeforeCompaction` and `runAfterCompaction` hooks were defined in the plugin system but never called. Now invoked in `compactEmbeddedPiSessionDirect()`.

2. **Race condition between delivery and compaction**: `appendAssistantMessageToSessionTranscript()` was appending to the session transcript without acquiring the write lock, while compaction holds the lock during modification. Added session write lock to coordinate both operations.

## Changes

- `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/compact.ts`: Add hook invocations with context (agentId, sessionKey, workspace, messageProvider)
- `src/config/sessions/transcript.ts`: Wrap transcript append in session write lock

## Test plan

- [x] Existing test suite passes (800+ tests)
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes
- [x] `pnpm build` passes

Split from #5400 for easier review.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes two issues in the embedded Pi compaction/delivery flow: it wires the previously-defined `before_compaction` / `after_compaction` plugin hooks into `compactEmbeddedPiSessionDirect()`, and it adds a session write lock around `appendAssistantMessageToSessionTranscript()` to prevent concurrent transcript writes from racing with compaction.

Overall this fits the existing design where compaction and other session mutations coordinate via `acquireSessionWriteLock`, and where plugin hooks are dispatched through the global hook runner.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Reasonably safe to merge, but there are a couple of hook/locking edge cases to resolve or align on.
- Core changes are small and aligned with existing concurrency patterns, but the compaction hook context may pass an undefined sessionKey, and the fire-and-forget `after_compaction` hook can interact poorly with the session write lock and session disposal if plugins touch the transcript.

## Comments

### @teren-papercutlabs (2026-02-01)

Addressed Greptile feedback in commit 9d1c0ae82:

1. **sessionKey fallback**: `hookCtx.sessionKey` now uses `params.sessionKey?.trim() || params.sessionId`
2. **await after_compaction**: Hook is now awaited before session disposal to prevent plugins accessing disposed session
3. **ensureSessionHeader inside lock**: Moved call inside the lock block to prevent TOCTOU race

Pushed directly to main per PcL workflow.
