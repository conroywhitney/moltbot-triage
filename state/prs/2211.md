## Description

## Summary
- Use `where` command on Windows instead of `which` for binary detection in `ensureBinary()`

## Problem
On Windows, `which` is not a native command. The `ensureBinary()` function in `src/infra/binaries.ts` was hardcoded to use `which`, causing skill detection to fail for skills requiring CLI binaries (e.g., blogwatcher, yt-dlp, ffmpeg).

Other parts of the codebase already handle this correctly:
- `src/commands/onboard-helpers.ts` line 304
- `src/daemon/program-args.ts` line 140

## Changes
- Added platform check: use `where` on Windows (`process.platform === "win32"`), `which` elsewhere

Fixes #2172
