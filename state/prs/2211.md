## Description

## Summary
- Use `where` command on Windows instead of `which` for binary detection in `ensureBinary()`

## Problem
On Windows, `which` is not a native command. The `ensureBinary()` function in `src/infra/binaries.ts` was hardcoded to use `which`, causing skill detection to fail for skills requiring CLI binaries (e.g., blogwatcher, yt-dlp, ffmpeg).

Other parts of the codebase already handle this correctly:
- `src/commands/onboard-helpers.ts` line 304
- `src/daemon/program-args.ts` line 140

## Changes
- Added platform check: use `where` on Windows (`process.platform === "win32"`), `which` elsewhere

Fixes #2172

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR improves cross-platform binary detection by updating `ensureBinary()` to use `where` on Windows (`win32`) and `which` elsewhere, and adjusts the unit test accordingly. It also tweaks CI submodule checkout steps to skip submodule updates when `.gitmodules` is absent.

The change fits into the existing infra layer (`src/infra/binaries.ts`) which gates features on required external CLIs; using `where` on Windows aligns it with other Windows-aware code paths mentioned in the PR description.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low-risk and should be safe to merge after verifying Windows CI scripting.
- The core change (switching `which`→`where` on Windows) is localized and covered by a unit test update. The main concern is the additional CI workflow edits: the new early-exit behavior and existing `which` usage under Windows bash shells could cause unintended CI failures or skipped submodule init in jobs that still need it.

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
[P1] `checks-windows` job uses `shell: bash` but still runs `which node`, which is typically not available in Git Bash on Windows (it’s a Unix tool, not a built-in). This can fail the Windows CI before tests/builds run.

Consider switching this to `command -v node` (in bash) or `where node` (in pwsh/cmd) to align with the intent of this PR.

Also appears in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` at `checks` install step (line ~161) and `checks-macos` install step (line ~355) if those runners ever lack `which`.
