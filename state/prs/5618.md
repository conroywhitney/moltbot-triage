## Description

## Summary
Signal group IDs are Base64-encoded and case-sensitive. Some routing and normalization paths were lowercasing these IDs, which breaks sending/reactions and can cause allowlist mismatches.

Fixes #4068 and #5578.

This was written with GPT 5.2-high but reviewed myself.

## What changed
- Preserve `peerId` casing when building Signal **group** session keys.
- Preserve session key casing for Signal **group** routes (avoid lowercasing the whole key).
- Preserve case for `group:` targets in Signal target normalization (strip whitespace but keep ID casing).

## Test plan
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm format`
- `bunx vitest run src/routing/session-key.test.ts src/channels/plugins/normalize/signal.test.ts`

**`src/routing/resolve-route.ts`**
`resolveAgentRoute` lowercases the *entire* `sessionKey` (`buildAgentSessionKey(...).toLowerCase()`), which will still destroy case-sensitive IDs like Signal group IDs even though `buildAgentPeerSessionKey` now preserves them. If this session key is used downstream for reactions/target reconstruction, this call site likely needs to avoid lowercasing for Signal group sessions (or otherwise normalize only the non-peerId parts).

Also appears in: `src/routing/resolve-route.ts:193` (mainSessionKey lowercasing is fine, but sessionKey is not for Signal groups).

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Thanks — good catch.

`resolveAgentRoute` was lowercasing the entire session key, which would still destroy case-sensitive Signal Base64 group IDs. I updated routing to preserve the session key casing for `signal` group routes, and also updated Signal target normalization to preserve case for `group:` targets.

Added focused regression tests for both.

@vignesh07 @sebslight - this should be OK to merge if you could please review 🙏
