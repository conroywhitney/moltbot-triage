## Description

Fixes #3038

Users hit "command not found: moltbot" after install because docs only reference `moltbot`, but package.json defines both `moltbot` and `clawdbot` bins. Some install methods may expose only `clawdbot`.

Changes:
- Add "try clawdbot (compatibility shim)" fallback in 7 key docs
- README, install docs, getting started, troubleshooting
- Consistent messaging: try clawdbot first → then check PATH
- All links follow Mintlify root-relative convention

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates key docs (README + install/getting-started/troubleshooting pages) to clarify that both `moltbot` and the `clawdbot` compatibility shim may be available after installation, and to direct users to PATH troubleshooting when neither command is found.

The changes are localized to documentation and align with the repository’s CLI packaging behavior (multiple bins), reducing “command not found” confusion during onboarding.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk and largely safe to merge since it only adjusts documentation text.
- Changes are limited to docs and improve troubleshooting guidance; the only notable issue spotted is inconsistent link style in README (absolute URL vs stated root-relative convention).
- README.md (link consistency)
