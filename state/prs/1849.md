## Description

## Summary

When a cron job with `agentTurn` payload completes, the `cron.finished` event now includes the delivery target fields (`channel` and `to`) from the original job payload. This enables gateway clients to deliver cron messages to specific channels instead of broadcasting to all user platforms.

**Use case:** When an agent schedules a reminder like "Remind me on Discord: ...", the external gateway can now deliver the message only to Discord instead of all channels.

## Changes

- Add `channel` and `to` fields to `CronEvent` type (`src/cron/service/state.ts`)
- Add `channel` and `to` fields to `CronRunLogEntrySchema` (`src/gateway/protocol/schema/cron.ts`)
- Include `channel` and `to` from `job.payload` when emitting finished event (`src/cron/service/timer.ts`)

## Backward Compatibility

Both fields are optional. Existing clients that don't use these fields will continue to work unchanged.

## Test Plan

- [x] Code review for type safety
- [ ] Unit tests (existing tests should pass)
- [ ] E2E test: Schedule cron with specific channel, verify finished event contains channel/to
