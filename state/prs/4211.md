## Description

Adds per-channel inbound delay configuration for multi-bot coordination in shared channels.

## Changes
- Add `channelDelayMs` and `channelDelayMsByChannel` config options
- Add `skipIfPeerRepliedMs` to skip responding if another bot already replied
- Resolve channel delay per-message using Discord channel ID (not at startup)

## Use Case
When multiple bots share a channel, this prevents response storms by:
1. Delaying response by a configurable amount per channel
2. Checking if a peer bot already replied during the delay
3. Skipping the response if a peer handled it

## Config Example
```json
{
  "messages": {
    "inbound": {
      "channelDelayMsByChannel": {
        "<discord-channel-id>": 5000
      },
      "skipIfPeerRepliedMs": 10000
    }
  }
}
```
