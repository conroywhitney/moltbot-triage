## Description

## HOTFIX

Tool summaries were not being sent to chat channels when verbose mode was enabled (`/verbose on`).

### Problem
The `onToolResult` callback was defined in the types but never wired up in `dispatch-from-config.ts`. This meant that even with verbose mode enabled, tool summaries were silently dropped instead of being sent to WhatsApp, Telegram, and other chat channels.

### Solution
Added the missing `onToolResult` callback alongside `onBlockReply`, using the same `dispatcher.sendBlockReply()` path to deliver tool summaries.

### Testing
- Tested on WhatsApp with `/verbose on`
- Tool summaries now appear as separate messages when tools are invoked

### Changes
- `src/auto-reply/reply/dispatch-from-config.ts`: Wire up `onToolResult` callback (+10 lines)
