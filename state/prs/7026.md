<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds Korean-language documentation: a translated GitHub README (`README.ko.md`) plus initial Korean Mintlify docs scaffolding under `docs/ko-KR/` and a Korean glossary entry file under `docs/.i18n/`. These files mirror the existing English docs structure and provide localized onboarding/getting-started content for Korean readers.

The main issue noticed is several newly-added docs files missing a trailing newline at EOF, which commonly causes formatter/linter noise and messy diffs later.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it is docs-only with minor formatting nits.
- Review focused on the new documentation files; changes are additive and don’t affect runtime behavior. Only minor consistency issues (missing trailing newlines) were found that could cause future diff/format churn.
- docs/.i18n/glossary.ko-KR.json; docs/ko-KR/index.md; docs/ko-KR/start/getting-started.md; docs/ko-KR/start/wizard.md
