## Description

…ckage glob pattern from 'packages/*' to 'packages/**' to properly include all nested packages under the packages directory. This resolves ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND errors during builds.  Fixes #2745

This fix addresses issue #2745 where pnpm fails during builds due to workspace packages not being properly resolved. By changing the glob pattern from 'packages/*' to 'packages/**', we ensure that all nested packages are included in the workspace configuration, fixing the ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND error.
