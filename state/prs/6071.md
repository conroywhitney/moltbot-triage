## Description

## Summary

Adds the `--thread-id` option to the `openclaw message read` CLI command to enable reading thread replies on Slack and Telegram.

## Problem

When trying to read Slack thread replies using the message tool or CLI, the `threadId` parameter wasn't being passed through. The CLI `read` command was missing the `--thread-id` option entirely.

## Investigation

Traced through the codebase and found:

1. ✅ `slack.actions.ts` correctly reads `threadId` from params and passes it to `handleSlackAction`
2. ✅ `handleSlackAction` correctly passes `threadId` to `readSlackMessages`
3. ✅ `readSlackMessages` correctly uses `conversations.replies` when `threadId` is set
4. ✅ The message tool schema includes `threadId` (from `buildSendSchema`)
5. ✅ Existing test `slack.actions.test.ts` confirms threadId forwarding works
6. ❌ CLI `read` command was missing `--thread-id` option

## Changes

- Added `--thread-id <id>` option to the `message read` CLI command

## Testing

- [x] Code follows existing patterns
- [x] Existing test `slack.actions.test.ts` verifies the action handler works correctly
- [ ] Manual e2e testing pending

## AI Disclosure

🤖 This PR was AI-assisted (created with Claude). The investigation and fix were done by tracing through the codebase to identify where `threadId` support was missing.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a missing `--thread-id <id>` option to the `openclaw message read` CLI command so the CLI can forward `threadId` into the existing message action pipeline (which already supports reading Slack thread replies / Telegram thread context).

This change is localized to the CLI command registration alongside the existing message read flags (limit/before/after/around/include-thread).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk and likely safe to merge.
- The change is a single CLI option addition that forwards an existing parameter; no behavioral changes occur unless the new flag is used. The only concern is user-facing clarity/consistency of the flag’s description across platforms.
- src/cli/program/message/register.read-edit-delete.ts (help text wording/consistency)
