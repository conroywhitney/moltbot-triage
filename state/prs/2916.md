## Description

## Summary

Adds [Morpheus Inference API](https://mor.org/) as a new provider, enabling access to open-source AI models through a decentralized inference marketplace.

- Full provider integration with onboarding flow, model discovery, and COMPAT settings
- Support for 14+ models including Kimi K2 Thinking, Qwen3 Coder 480B, Llama 3.3 70B
- Dynamic model discovery from `/models` endpoint with static catalog fallback
- CLI support via `--morpheus-api-key` flag for non-interactive setup

## Changes

- **New files:**
  - `src/agents/morpheus-models.ts` - Model catalog, discovery, and COMPAT settings
  - `docs/providers/morpheus.md` - Provider documentation

- **Modified files:**
  - Onboarding flow to support Morpheus API key entry
  - Auth choice routing and preferred-provider mapping
  - Venice provider: added COMPAT settings (mirrors PR #2500)

## Notes

- The `/models` endpoint is public (no auth required for discovery)
- Default model: `kimi-k2-thinking` (reasoning model)
- COMPAT: `supportsStore: false`, `supportsDeveloperRole: false`

## Testing

- [x] Build passes
- [x] Manual testing with Morpheus API key

This builds on top of the same structure as similar providers. Functionality has been tested and confirmed, you can contact me for a Morpheus API key if you’d like to do any specific testing here

Anything needed from me on this? Would love to get this integrated for our community
