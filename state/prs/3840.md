## Description

## Summary
- Adds `{ prefix: "meta", kind: "none" }` to `BASE_RELOAD_RULES_TAIL` in config-reload.ts
- Adds test case to verify `meta.lastTouchedAt` is treated as no-op

## Problem
When a tool modifies the config (e.g., `clawdbot agents add`), the `meta.lastTouchedAt` field gets updated. This triggered a full gateway restart via SIGUSR1, which aborted any in-flight LLM requests.

**Impact**: User experience was broken - the agent would do agentic work (run tools), but never send a final response because the HTTP request to Anthropic/OpenAI was aborted.

**Reproduction**:
1. User messages agent
2. Agent calls a tool that modifies clawdbot.json
3. Tool completes, writes to config
4. Config watcher detects change
5. Reload logic sees `meta.lastTouchedAt` changed
6. No rule exists for `meta` prefix → falls through to `restartGateway = true`
7. Gateway restarts, aborting in-flight requests

## Solution
Add `meta` to the list of no-op prefixes, similar to `identity`, `wizard`, and other metadata-like fields. Changes to `meta.*` fields will no longer trigger gateway restarts.

## Files changed
- `src/gateway/config-reload.ts` - Add `{ prefix: "meta", kind: "none" }` rule
- `src/gateway/config-reload.test.ts` - Add test case for `meta.lastTouchedAt`

## Test plan
- [x] Added unit test: `meta.lastTouchedAt` treated as no-op
- [ ] Manual test: Trigger a tool that modifies config during conversation, verify no restart

Fixes #3811

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the gateway config reload rules so changes under the `meta` prefix (e.g. `meta.lastTouchedAt`) are treated as no-ops, preventing unnecessary gateway restarts on metadata-only config writes. It also adds a unit test ensuring `buildGatewayReloadPlan(["meta.lastTouchedAt"])` does not request a restart and records the path as a no-op.

This fits into the existing reload-planning system in `src/gateway/config-reload.ts`, which diffs config snapshots into changed dot-paths and maps those paths to restart/hot/no-op behavior via prefix rules.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a small, localized adjustment to reload prefix rules plus a targeted unit test; it reduces restarts without affecting existing restart/hot-reload behavior for other prefixes.
- No files require special attention
