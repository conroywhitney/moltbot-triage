## Description

## Summary

- Add `README.zh-CN.md` with full Chinese translation matching the English README structure

- Include all sections: install, quick start, highlights, architecture, channels config, docs links, and full contributor list

## Test plan

- [x] Verify README.zh-CN.md renders correctly on GitHub
- [x] Verify language switcher links work in both files
- [x] Confirm section structure matches English version

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a Simplified Chinese translation of the top-level README (`README.zh-CN.md`) and introduces a language switcher line near the top of both the English and Chinese READMEs so readers can navigate between them.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk and safe to merge; changes are documentation-only with minor consistency nits.
- Review focused on the two touched files. No functional code changes; main concerns are small documentation UX inconsistencies (asymmetric language switcher and duplicated footer link block) that won’t affect runtime behavior.
- README.zh-CN.md (language switcher consistency/duplication)

[P2] Duplicate language switcher at bottom

`README.zh-CN.md` includes the language switcher again at the very end. Unless this is intentional, it’s likely accidental duplication and can read like leftover footer content.

[P2] Duplicate language switcher at bottom

`README.zh-CN.md` includes the language switcher again at the very end. Unless this is intentional, it’s likely accidental duplication and can read like leftover footer content.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Fixed in the latest commit. Both READMEs now use a single link each (link to the other language only), so the switcher is symmetric and consistent. The “both options are links” note referred to an earlier version.
