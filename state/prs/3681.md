## Description

## Summary

Fixes #2820

The `speak()` method returns `{ success: false, error }` instead of throwing on failure. Two call sites were not checking this return value, causing TTS errors to be silently swallowed:

1. `handleInboundResponse()` in webhook.ts - callers never received AI response audio
2. `continueCall()` in manager.ts - continued to "listening" state even when TTS failed

### Changes
- `extensions/voice-call/src/webhook.ts`: Check `speak()` return value and log errors
- `extensions/voice-call/src/manager.ts`: Check `speak()` return value in `continueCall()` and return early on failure

### Why this fix
The `speak()` method is designed to return error status rather than throw. Other call sites (CLI, gateway API, MCP tool, speakInitialMessage) properly check the return value. This fix aligns the remaining call sites with the established pattern.

## Test plan
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors (`pnpm build`)
- [x] Code passes formatting check (`pnpm format`)

### @orzelig — APPROVED (2026-01-29)

Good bug fix! The changes properly check speak() return values and handle failures. This aligns with the existing pattern used in other call sites. LGTM!

thanks for the approval! CI red is macos-app timeout (24h) - changes only touch voice-call extension files. ok to merge?
