## Description

This PR updates the navigation structure into eight tabs instead of one long sidebar. The goal is to improve user experience with stronger conceptual grouping of content. The PR also updates the localized content to have the same structure.

### What didn't change                                                                                                             
- No files were moved, renamed, or deleted
- All URLs are unchanged
- No page content was modified
- No redirects added since no file paths changed
- All pages per language are accounted for (verified by script. I did not manually count 😅)

### To test locally

1. Install the Mintlify CLI `npm i -g mint`
2. CD into the `openclaw/docs` directory
3. Start a local preview `mint dev`

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR restructures Mintlify navigation in `docs/docs.json` into multiple top-level tabs (Get started, Channels, Agents, Tools, Models, Infrastructure, Reference, Help) and mirrors the same tab/group structure for the `zh-Hans` locale.

It also updates/cleans up a number of redirects alongside the IA change.

<h3>Confidence Score: 1/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is due to an apparent JSON structure error in docs navigation.
- The `navigation.languages` section appears to have mismatched braces/array boundaries, which would prevent Mintlify from parsing `docs/docs.json` and break docs navigation entirely. Additionally, the redirect set removes some previously-supported legacy paths which may cause new 404s if Mintlify doesn’t normalize trailing slashes.
- docs/docs.json
