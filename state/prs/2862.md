## Description

## Summary
- Fixes control UI failing with "Control UI assets not found" when gateway runs via systemd
- The systemd service was generated without WorkingDirectory, causing cwd to be user's home directory
- Now derives workingDirectory from the CLI entrypoint path for all production runtimes

## Test plan
- [x] Run `moltbot gateway install` and verify service file contains `WorkingDirectory`
- [x] Restart gateway and verify control UI loads at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`
- [x] Run `moltbot doctor --repair` and verify WorkingDirectory persists

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates gateway service argument resolution to also compute a `workingDirectory` for production runtimes (node/bun/auto) by deriving it from the built CLI entrypoint path under `dist/`. That working directory then propagates into systemd unit generation so the gateway runs with a predictable CWD and can find Control UI assets (which otherwise may fall back to `process.cwd()`).

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; it adds a straightforward working-directory derivation for service generation.
- Change scope is small and localized to service argument construction; behavior is additive and gated to production/runtime service paths. Main residual concern is edge-case path parsing when `dist` appears multiple times in the entrypoint path, which could mis-derive the directory in uncommonLine layouts.
