## Description

## Summary
- Fixes control UI failing with "Control UI assets not found" when gateway runs via systemd
- The systemd service was generated without WorkingDirectory, causing cwd to be user's home directory
- Now derives workingDirectory from the CLI entrypoint path for all production runtimes

## Test plan
- [x] Run `moltbot gateway install` and verify service file contains `WorkingDirectory`
- [x] Restart gateway and verify control UI loads at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`
- [x] Run `moltbot doctor --repair` and verify WorkingDirectory persists
