## Description

Users complaining in discord that it doesn't work (it's the default openrouter model)

Looks like there was a misdiagnosis earlier due to the way prefixing works

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates how the OpenRouter “auto” model is represented across onboarding/auth flows and the model picker.

- The OpenRouter default model ref is changed to `openrouter/openrouter/auto` to match the current `modelKey(provider, id)` prefixing behavior when catalog IDs already include `openrouter/auto`.
- The model picker no longer hides router-internal entries and tests are updated to assert the new key format appears in selection options.
- Auth/onboarding tests are updated to expect the new OpenRouter default model ref when `openrouter-api-key` is selected.

These changes primarily affect the default model written to config and what appears in interactive model selection, ensuring the OpenRouter auto default can be selected/resolved under the current keying logic.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but the model key format change is risky for compatibility and user-facing config semantics.
- Core changes are small and covered by updated tests, but persisting `openrouter/openrouter/auto` as the default model ref is an unusual key format that may conflict with other parts of the codebase or existing user configs expecting `openrouter/auto`. The removal of the router-model filter also changes UX and could expose uncallable entries depending on provider catalogs.
- src/commands/onboard-auth.credentials.ts, src/commands/model-picker.ts

not that my approval means much, but this tracks with my manual testing changing the config locally

**`src/commands/model-picker.ts`**
[P3] With `HIDDEN_ROUTER_MODELS` removed, `promptDefaultModel`/`promptModelAllowlist` will now surface internal routing entries (like OpenRouter’s `auto`) alongside regular models. If that’s intended, consider updating the UI hint/label so users understand it’s a routing alias rather than a concrete model (and avoid confusion with the duplicated key format). If it’s not intended, keeping a targeted filter for only truly-unselectable entries would preserve the earlier UX.

Also appears in: `src/commands/model-picker.ts:321-335`.
