## Description

## Summary
- Adds preflight check before gateway restart to validate auth config
- If preflight fails, automatically rolls back to `.bak` config file
- Prevents gateway from crashing due to missing auth token after config change

Fixes #6070

## Changes
- `src/gateway/config-preflight.ts` - New preflight validation function
- `src/config/rollback.ts` - Config rollback utility
- `src/gateway/config-reload.ts` - Integrated preflight check before restart

## Test plan
- [x] Unit tests for `preflightGatewayConfig`
- [x] Unit tests for `rollbackToBackupConfig`
- [x] Existing `config-reload.test.ts` still passes
- [x] `pnpm build` succeeds

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a gateway config preflight (`preflightGatewayConfig`) that validates auth settings before performing restart-based config reloads, and introduces a rollback helper (`rollbackToBackupConfig`) that restores the last `.bak` config when preflight fails. `startGatewayConfigReloader` now runs the preflight prior to invoking `onRestart` in both `restart` mode and the restart-required path in `hybrid` mode, logging failures and attempting rollback to keep the gateway from crashing on invalid auth configuration.


<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but there is a state-management bug around rollback that could cause repeated reload behavior after a failed preflight.
- Changes are localized and covered by unit tests, but `config-reload.ts` updates `currentConfig` before running preflight/rollback, which can desync in-memory state from the rolled-back file and lead to confusing reload loops in the failure scenario.

**`src/gateway/config-reload.ts`**
[P1] `currentConfig` is updated before preflight/rollback, so a failed preflight will still advance the in-memory config state.

In `runReload`, `currentConfig = nextConfig` happens immediately after reading the snapshot, before `preflightGatewayConfig` + `rollbackToBackupConfig` checks. If preflight fails and you rollback the file + `return`, the next change event may compare against the already-updated `currentConfig` and treat the (rolled-back) config as a new change, potentially causing repeated reload attempts/looping or incorrect `changedPaths`/plan decisions. This only triggers when preflight fails and rollback occurs.
