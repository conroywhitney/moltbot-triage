## Description

## Why this is needed

This PR allows Brave Search API Proxies to be used

## Summary

- Add `tools.web.search.baseUrl` config option to override the default Brave Search endpoint (useful for self-hosted instances or proxies)
- Add `tools.web.search.authStyle` config option to switch between `"x-subscription-token"` (Brave default) and `"bearer"` (for proxies that expect `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`)

## Acknowledgements

 - This PR was made with the assistance of AI in Cursor
 - This PR was __NOT__ "vibe-coded"
 - Yes, I am aware of what the code does. The code was based and styled on pre-existing code in the codebase
 - This PR has __NOT__ been tested as im still running "ClawdBot" and there is no clear migration path to the new "MoltBot" folders and configs.
