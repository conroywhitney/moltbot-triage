## Description

AI-assisted: yes
Testing: fully tested locally

## What & Why
Bug: From Remote mode, switching **Moltbot runs → Not configured** immediately snapped back to Remote.
Cause: `gateway.mode` was removed, but a stale `gateway.remote.url` remained. On reload, the app treated "mode unset + remote url present" as Remote.

## Fix
When `connectionMode == .unconfigured`, clear `gateway.remote.url` during config sync so the app does not implicitly re-select Remote mode.

## Test plan
- ./scripts/restart-mac.sh --no-sign
- cd apps/macos && swift build
- Verified the picker stays on **Not configured** after switching from Remote.

## Notes
- I understand this change clears `gateway.remote.url` when selecting "Not configured".
