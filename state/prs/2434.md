## Description

### **Summary**
Updated `docker-setup.sh` to include a check for Bash 4+

### **Detail**
The `docker-setup.sh` script uses associative arrays (declare -A) which require Bash 4+. macOS ships with Bash 3.2 causing the script to fail with "declare: -A: invalid option". The new code adds both a check for macOS and Bash 4+ and provides a helpful error message directing macOS users to install Bash via Homebrew.

### **Testing**
_Lightly tested on macOS 26_
Successfully demonstrated:
- [x] With shipping version of Bash -> script stops and lets the user know that they should install the latest version of bash with homebrew
- [x] With latest version of Bash -> script continues forward with no errors.
