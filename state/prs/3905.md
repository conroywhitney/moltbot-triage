## Description

I am using google-gemini model as my primary model, but whenever I click new session, it throws `Error: No API key found for provider "anthropic"`

## Problem
Internal tools (like llm-slug-generator) calls `runEmbeddedPiAgent` without specifying a model. The runner was hardcoded to fall back to anthropic/claude-opus-4-5. If the I have no Anthropic key, it crashes.

## Solution
Modified `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.ts` to check `params.config.agents.defaults.model.primary` before reverting to hardcoded defaults.
