## Description

## Summary

- Adds fast-path for `cron.list` and `cron.status` operations when the store is already loaded
- Prevents RPC timeouts during long-running cron job executions

## Problem

When a cron job executes with `wakeMode: "now"`, it can block for up to 2 minutes waiting for the heartbeat. During this time, all other cron operations queue behind the global lock in `locked.js`, causing Gateway RPC timeouts for simple read-only operations like `cron.list` and `cron.status`.

## Solution

For read-only operations (`list` and `status`), check if `state.store` is already loaded. If so, return the data immediately without acquiring the lock. This is safe because:

1. These operations only read data, they don't modify state
2. The store is only loaded once and kept in memory  
3. Slight staleness (reading during a concurrent write) is acceptable for status/list operations

## Related Issues

- #5703 Gateway RPC timeouts during concurrent tool calls
- #6331 Cron module deadlock with periodic main+systemEvent+wakeMode:now tasks
- #5313 Cron handler deadlocks when multiple one-shot jobs are overdue

## Related PRs

- #4711 takes a similar approach (still open)

## Test plan

- [ ] Run `cron.list` and `cron.status` while a long-running cron job is executing
- [ ] Verify no timeout errors occur
- [ ] Verify returned data is accurate

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds an early return (“fast-path”) in `src/cron/service/ops.ts` for `cron.status` and `cron.list` when `state.store` is already loaded, skipping the global `locked()` queue to avoid RPC timeouts during long-running cron job executions (notably `wakeMode: "now"`). The existing locked path remains for cold starts where the store isn’t loaded yet, preserving the current load/persist/timer behavior while reducing contention for read-only calls.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and should reduce lock contention, with minor behavioral edge cases to double-check.
- The change is localized to `status`/`list` and doesn’t modify locking for mutating operations, so it should address the timeout issue without broad side effects. The main risk is subtle behavioral divergence between the fast-path and locked-path (e.g., how disabled cron should be reported, and how jobs without `nextRunAtMs` are ordered).
- src/cron/service/ops.ts (fast-path semantics vs disabled cron expectations)

## Comments

### @floraiNx (2026-02-02)

## Regarding Greptile's feedback

**P0 - `cronEnabled` handling:**

The `status()` fast-path already handles this correctly:
```typescript
nextWakeAtMs: state.deps.cronEnabled ? (nextWakeAtMs(state) ?? null) : null,
```

For `list()`, the fast-path returns jobs regardless of `cronEnabled` - but this matches the existing locked-path behavior exactly. The `warnIfDisabled()` check is only used for mutating operations (`add`, `update`, `remove`, `run`), not for read-only operations. So this is not a regression.

**P2 - Sort order for missing `nextRunAtMs`:**

The `?? 0` fallback in the sort comparator is copied directly from the existing locked-path code to maintain consistency:
```typescript
// Line 87 - existing code
return jobs.toSorted((a, b) => (a.state.nextRunAtMs ?? 0) - (b.state.nextRunAtMs ?? 0));
```

If this should be changed to `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, that would be a separate improvement affecting both paths.

## Regarding the failing CI test

The `ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rmdir` error in `src/cron/service.prevents-duplicate-timers.test.ts` is a flaky test cleanup issue (race condition in temp directory removal), not related to my changes. I ran the test suite locally multiple times:
- First run: same flaky failure
- Second run: all 4998 tests passed

This appears to be a pre-existing intermittent issue in the test infrastructure.

### @floraiNx (2026-02-02)

**Update on CI failures:**

The lint errors are pre-existing in the `main` branch - they're not introduced by this PR:

```
src/agents/tools/nodes-tool.ts:457 - eslint(preserve-caught-error)
src/auto-reply/reply/commands-ptt.ts:192 - typescript-eslint(no-unnecessary-type-assertion)
extensions/matrix/src/matrix/send/types.ts:72 - typescript-eslint(no-duplicate-type-constituents)
```

I verified this by running `npm run lint` on both `main` and my branch - same 3 errors on both.

My PR only modifies `src/cron/service/ops.ts`.
