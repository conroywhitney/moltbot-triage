## Description

## Description
Automated Docker setup with environment-based configuration for easier deployment.

## Changes
- **docker-entrypoint.sh**: Auto-onboarding script using environment variables
- **docker-compose.yml**: Added env var support for ports, bind mode, tokens
- **docker-setup.sh**: Simplified to manage .env and start containers
- **.env.example**: Configuration template for users
- **openclaw-docker**: Global CLI wrapper for Docker deployments
- **DOCKER_CLI_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive CLI documentation

## Motivation
Makes Docker deployment a single command (`./docker-setup.sh`) with automatic configuration instead of manual onboarding steps.

## Testing
- ✅ Clean install tested
- ✅ Gateway starts and is accessible
- ✅ Configuration persists across restarts
- ✅ Plugin installation works
- ✅ CLI wrapper functional
- ✅ Build passes: `pnpm build && pnpm check`

## Docker Image
Published to Docker Hub: `syn0001/openclaw:latest`  
https://hub.docker.com/r/syn0001/openclaw

## Usage Example
```bash
# One-command setup
./docker-setup.sh

# Global CLI
openclaw status
openclaw plugin-list
openclaw dashboard
```

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR introduces an automated Docker onboarding flow: `.env.example` is repurposed for gateway/CLI configuration, `docker-setup.sh` now creates `.env` and starts compose, `docker-entrypoint.sh` performs first-run non-interactive onboarding inside the container, and a helper wrapper (`openclaw-docker`) plus a CLI guide are added.

The overall direction makes container startup simpler, but a few pieces are currently brittle: the wrapper and docs contain hardcoded developer-local paths, the wrapper assumes a fixed container name, and the entrypoint builds the onboarding args as a single string (and logs it), which can break with real-world tokens/values and can leak secrets into container logs.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- Not safe to merge as-is due to hardcoded paths/container naming and brittle onboarding arg handling.
- Several issues will cause immediate breakage for most users (absolute `/Users/...` paths, fixed container name) and the onboarding entrypoint logs and word-splits sensitive env-derived args, which is error-prone and can leak secrets.
- openclaw-docker, DOCKER_CLI_GUIDE.md, docker-entrypoint.sh, docker-compose.yml
