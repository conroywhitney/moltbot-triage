## Description

## Summary
- Fixes webchat message persistence when using CLI backends (claude-cli, codex-cli)
- Messages now persist correctly to transcript files and survive page reloads

## Problem
When using CLI backends, assistant messages appeared during the chat session but disappeared after page reload. This happened because:
1. The `chatLink` was not being registered in `onAgentRunStart`, causing agent events to not be properly routed
2. The `agentRunStarted` flag bypassed the normal message persistence path in the gateway

## Solution
1. Register `chatLink` in `onAgentRunStart` callback so agent events are properly mapped to client runIds
2. Add `saveAssistantToTranscript()` function that persists assistant messages directly to the session transcript JSONL file
3. Call this function in `emitChatFinal` when a CLI backend run completes successfully

## Testing
- Tested with claude-cli backend on local OpenClaw instance
- Verified messages persist correctly in session transcript files
- Confirmed messages survive page reload in webchat UI

## Related Issues
Fixes #5660
Fixes #2977

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes missing webchat persistence for CLI-backed runs by (1) registering the agent `runId` to client `runId` mapping in `onAgentRunStart` so agent events route correctly, and (2) appending assistant final text to the session transcript when a run completes.

The overall approach matches the existing gateway architecture: webchat UI reloads come from transcript JSONL (`readSessionMessages`), while live updates come from the agent event bus and chat broadcasts. The new `addChatRun(agentRunId, { clientRunId, sessionKey })` ensures those streams line up for CLI backends.

Main concern: the new persistence helper in `server-chat.ts` appears to resolve the transcript path using `entry.sessionId` rather than the agent’s session id, which can append to a different transcript than the one the UI reload path reads. There’s also a risk of skipped persistence when the transcript file doesn’t exist, and potential duplication if backends already write assistant messages to the transcript.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but there’s a meaningful risk the new transcript append targets the wrong session file for some CLI runs.
- Event routing fix via `onAgentRunStart` is straightforward and aligns with existing `addChatRun` usage elsewhere. The new transcript append is plausible, but it uses `entry.sessionId` for path resolution, which may differ from the agent session id used by `readSessionMessages()` and other transcript writers; that mismatch could negate the intended persistence or misattribute messages. No automated tests were added for this new behavior.
- src/gateway/server-chat.ts (transcript write path resolution); src/gateway/server-methods/chat.ts (runId mapping assumptions)

[P2] Persisting in `emitChatFinal` may cause duplicate transcript entries.

When an agent backend already writes its own transcript entries, this unconditional append on `jobState === "done"` can duplicate assistant messages (one from the backend, one from the gateway). If this is only intended for CLI backends that *don’t* write assistant messages, it may need a backend/type guard, or a check that the last transcript entry isn’t already this assistant message.

### @JorgeAlan (2026-02-01)

Thanks for the detailed review! You've identified valid concerns. Here's my analysis:

## Addressing the feedback

### [P0] Wrong session file path
**Valid concern.** The current implementation uses `loadSessionEntry(sessionKey)` which may resolve to a different sessionId than the agent's actual transcript file.

**Proposed fix:** Pass the correct `sessionId`, `storePath`, and `sessionFile` from `chat.ts` through the `ChatRunEntry` when registering the chatLink in `onAgentRunStart`. This ensures we use the exact same path resolution as `appendAssistantTranscriptMessage()`.

### [P2] Transcript file not created if missing
**Valid concern.** First message scenario would silently fail.

**Proposed fix:** Create the transcript file with a proper session header when missing (similar to `ensureTranscriptFile()`).

### [P2] Duplicate messages for non-CLI runs
**Valid concern.** Embedded backends already persist their assistant messages.

**Proposed fix:** The `chatLink` in the registry is only created for CLI runs (via `onAgentRunStart` which is only called by `runCliAgent`). We can use `chatLink` existence as a guard - only persist when `chatLink` is present.

## Implementation plan

1. Extend `ChatRunEntry` type to include `sessionId`, `storePath`, `sessionFile`
2. Pass this info when calling `context.addChatRun()` in `chat.ts`
3. Update `saveAssistantToTranscript()` to:
   - Accept `ChatRunEntry` instead of `sessionKey`
   - Return early if no chatLink (non-CLI run guard)
   - Create transcript file if missing
   - Use the passed session info for correct path

I'll push an updated commit with these fixes. Let me know if you'd prefer a different approach.

## Updated: Review feedback addressed ✅

Pushed commit `3ee419e55` with the following fixes:

### [P0] Wrong session file path
- Now passes `sessionId`, `storePath`, `sessionFile` through `ChatRunEntry` when registering the chatLink
- Uses the exact same path resolution as `appendAssistantTranscriptMessage()`

### [P2] Transcript file not created if missing  
- Creates the transcript file with a proper session header if it doesn't exist
- Handles first-message scenarios correctly

### [P2] Duplicate messages for non-CLI runs
- `saveAssistantToTranscript()` now only executes when `chatLink` exists
- `chatLink` is only created for CLI providers (via `onAgentRunStart` in the CLI code path)
- Embedded backends continue using their existing persistence mechanism

The key insight is that `chatLink` serves as a natural guard for CLI-only persistence since it's only registered for CLI runs.
