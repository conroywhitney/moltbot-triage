## Description

## Summary

Fixes #4336

- Add `channels.signal.groups.<groupId>` config to allow specific Signal groups by ID
- Groups listed in this config bypass the sender-level `groupAllowFrom` check
- Matches the pattern used by Telegram and iMessage for group allowlists

## Changes

- Add `SignalGroupConfig` type and `groups` property to Signal config schema
- Add `SignalGroupSchema` to Zod validation
- Add `resolveChannelGroupPolicy` check in Signal event handler
- Add tests for group-level allowlist functionality  
- Update docs to explain `groupAllowFrom` (senders) vs `groups` (group IDs)

## Usage

```json5
{
  channels: {
    signal: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groups: {
        "your-signal-group-id": {}  // Allow this specific group
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

- Added unit tests for group-level allowlist
- Manually tested on live Signal instance
