## Description

### Problem
Cron jobs with `sessionTarget=main` and `wakeMode=next-heartbeat` were still calling `requestHeartbeatNow()`, effectively behaving like `wakeMode=now`. In practice this can cause cron-triggered systemEvent jobs to immediately run the main agent and potentially post output into the last active chat route (e.g. Discord channels), which is surprising and can look like spam.

### Fix
- In `CronService` timer execution, only call `requestHeartbeatNow()` for main jobs when `wakeMode=now`.
- For `wakeMode=next-heartbeat`, enqueue the systemEvent and do **not** force a heartbeat.

### Tests
- Added a unit test asserting `requestHeartbeatNow` is not called for main jobs with `wakeMode=next-heartbeat`.
- Updated the existing shared-store duplicate timer test to reflect the corrected semantics.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adjusts cron execution semantics for `sessionTarget=main` jobs so that `wakeMode=next-heartbeat` no longer forces an immediate heartbeat via `requestHeartbeatNow()`. Instead, the system event is enqueued and will be processed on the next scheduled heartbeat, preventing cron-triggered jobs from unexpectedly running the main agent immediately.

The change is implemented in `src/cron/service/timer.ts` within `executeJob()`’s main-job path: `requestHeartbeatNow()` is now gated to `wakeMode === "now"` in the fallback branch when `runHeartbeatOnce` is unavailable. Tests were updated/added to lock in the behavior and to reflect that shared-store timers should not force a heartbeat when `wakeMode=next-heartbeat`.


<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is largely safe to merge and aligns behavior with documented wakeMode semantics.
- The behavioral change is narrowly scoped (gating a heartbeat request on `wakeMode === "now"`) and is covered by new/updated unit tests. Primary remaining risk is test robustness around fake-timer execution ordering rather than production behavior.
