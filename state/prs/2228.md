## Description

## Summary

When creating an isolated cron job with `--message` but without `--deliver` or `--to`, the job runs but the agent output goes nowhere. This is a common mistake that's hard to debug - the job appears to succeed but nothing is actually delivered.

This was discovered when an LLM agent (running on clawdbot) created hourly check-in jobs that never sent messages. The agent assumed `--message` meant the message would be sent, but without `--deliver --channel --to`, the output just disappears.

## Changes

- Add a warning when creating isolated jobs without delivery configuration
- Suggests adding `--deliver --channel <channel> --to <dest>` for proactive delivery

## Example

Before (silent failure):
```bash
clawdbot cron add --name "reminder" --at +10m --session isolated --message "Check email"
# Job runs, output goes nowhere, no indication of the problem
```

After (helpful warning):
```bash
clawdbot cron add --name "reminder" --at +10m --session isolated --message "Check email"
# warning: isolated job has --message but no --deliver or --to; agent output will not be sent.
# Add --deliver --channel <channel> --to <dest> if you want proactive message delivery.
```

## Test plan

- [x] Existing tests pass (`vitest run src/cli/cron-cli.test.ts`)
- [x] Lint passes
- [ ] Manual test: create isolated job without delivery, verify warning appears
