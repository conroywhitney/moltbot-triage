## Description

Adds timeout handling for agent CLI connections to prevent hanging when the gateway is unreachable or slow to respond.

## Changes
- Added handshake timeout for connection establishment
- Improved error handling for connection failures
- Clearer error messages when connection times out

## Testing
Tested locally with various network conditions.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds faster failure behavior for gateway CLI connections by:
- Setting a WebSocket `handshakeTimeout` in `GatewayClient` to prevent hanging during connection establishment.
- Plumbing a new `onConnectError` path through `callGateway` so connection failures surface as clearer CLI errors with connection details.

These changes fit into the existing gateway client lifecycle (`GatewayClient.start()` wiring and `callGateway`’s promise-based connect/request flow) and should improve operator UX when the gateway is unreachable or slow.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge and is a focused improvement to connection failure behavior.
- Changes are small and localized to gateway connection setup and error plumbing; the new `handshakeTimeout` is a standard ws option and the new callback is guarded to avoid double-settle. The main concern is message formatting consistency (literal `\\n`), not runtime correctness.
- src/gateway/call.ts (error message formatting), src/gateway/client.ts (ensure handshakeTimeout aligns with desired CLI timeout behavior)
