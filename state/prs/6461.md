## Description

This change prevents the skills file watcher from traversing Python virtual
environments and cache directories when they exist inside a skill folder.

By excluding common paths such as .venv and __pycache__, this avoids excessive
file descriptor usage and prevents EMFILE crashes, while preserving normal
skill reload behavior.

Fixes #6429

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates the skills file watcher (`src/agents/skills/refresh.ts`) to ignore common Python virtualenv and cache directories (e.g., `.venv`, `venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.cache`) in addition to existing ignores like `.git`, `node_modules`, and `dist`. The intent is to prevent chokidar from traversing large Python env trees inside skills directories, reducing file descriptor usage and avoiding `EMFILE` crashes while keeping skill reload behavior intact.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR looks safe to merge; it only broadens watcher ignore patterns and does not change core watcher logic.
- Changes are confined to adding additional ignored directory regexes and some formatting; the regexes are anchored to path segments and should reduce traversal/FD load without affecting legitimate skill files outside those directories.
- No files require special attention

### @Coderxrohan (2026-02-01)

@onutc & @sebslight,
This change cleanly addresses the watcher issue by excluding common Python virtualenv and cache directories.
The approach is low-risk and aligns well with existing ignore patterns, preventing FD exhaustion without affecting normal skill reloads.
Looks good to merge.
Thanks!
