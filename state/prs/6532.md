## Description

This PR fixes the issue where dragging and dropping an image file into the chat input area would cause the browser to open the image in a new tab instead of uploading it.

Changes:
- Added `handleFiles` helper to process both pasted and dropped files.
- Updated `handlePaste` to use `handleFiles`.
- Added `handleDrop` to handle file drops.
- Added `@dragover` and `@drop` event listeners to the chat textarea.

Fixes #6525

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This change adds shared file-handling logic for image attachments in the chat composer, then wires it into both paste and drag-and-drop flows. The textarea now prevents default browser navigation on image drops and reads dropped/pasted images via `FileReader` to append them to `props.attachments`.

Main concern: multi-file paste/drop can lose attachments due to async `FileReader.onload` callbacks appending based on a potentially stale `props.attachments` snapshot.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge, but multi-image drops/pastes may intermittently lose attachments.
- The change is localized and addresses the reported browser default behavior, but the new async `FileReader` update pattern can race when multiple files are handled concurrently, causing state overwrites.

**`ui/src/ui/views/chat.ts`**
[P1] `handleFiles` appends attachments inside each `FileReader.onload` callback using `props.attachments ?? []` at callback time (`const current = props.attachments ?? []`). When multiple images are pasted/dropped at once, these async callbacks can race and overwrite each other, resulting in only the last-loaded image being kept.

Consider accumulating the new attachments first and calling `onAttachmentsChange` once, or using a functional update pattern (if available) so each callback appends to the latest state.
