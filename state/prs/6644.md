## Description

## What

Adds a new bundled skill that helps agents identify and remove signs of AI-generated writing, making text sound natural and human.

**Repo:** [brandonwise/humanizer](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer) (MIT, public)

## Why

AI-generated text has identifiable patterns that make it sound robotic — overused vocabulary, uniform sentence structure, significance inflation, chatbot artifacts. This skill teaches agents to detect and fix these patterns.

Based on:
- [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) — maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup
- [Copyleaks stylistic fingerprint research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01659) — academic paper on LLM writing patterns
- Community analysis of 500+ overused AI words and phrases

## What the skill covers

**24 pattern detectors** across 5 categories:
- **Content** — significance inflation, vague attributions, superficial analyses, promotional language
- **Language** — AI vocabulary (500+ words in 3 tiers), copula avoidance, synonym cycling, negative parallelisms
- **Style** — em dash/boldface/emoji overuse, curly quotes, title case headings
- **Communication** — chatbot artifacts, sycophantic tone, cutoff disclaimers
- **Filler** — wordy phrases, excessive hedging, generic conclusions

**Statistical signals:**
- Burstiness (sentence length variation)
- Type-token ratio (vocabulary diversity)
- Sentence length coefficient of variation

**Before/after example included** showing real transformation from AI-sounding to human writing.

## Optional companion CLI

The skill works standalone (pure SKILL.md instructions), but users can optionally install the [humanizer CLI](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer) for programmatic text scoring:

```bash
echo "text" | node src/cli.js score   # 0-100
node src/cli.js analyze -f draft.md    # Full report
```

- 128 tests passing
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Scores AI text 70+ and human text under 25

## Checklist

- [x] SKILL.md with proper YAML frontmatter (name, description, homepage, metadata)
- [x] Follows bundled skill structure (single SKILL.md in skills/humanizer/)
- [x] No external dependencies required
- [x] Comprehensive documentation with examples
- [x] MIT licensed

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new bundled skill at `skills/humanizer/SKILL.md` that guides agents in detecting common LLM-writing artifacts (24 patterns + vocab tiers + a few statistical signals) and rewriting text to sound more natural, with a before/after example and an optional external CLI for scoring.

Overall the skill is well-scoped and self-contained; the main nits are a small internal consistency issue (the H1 is Title Case while the skill flags Title Case headings as AI-like) and clarifying that the external CLI install is truly optional to avoid confusing users.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge; it’s documentation-only with minor clarity/consistency nits.
- Only a new SKILL.md is added. No runtime code changes or dependencies are introduced, so functional risk is low. The remaining issues are documentation consistency/clarity that could confuse users but won’t break builds.

## Comments

### @brandonwise (2026-02-02)

Rebased on latest main and reformatted SKILL.md with `oxfmt`. Both review comments addressed.

The lint and format CI failures are pre-existing on main ([`oauth.ts` type assertion](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/21573308125/job/62155996645) and [`CHANGELOG.md`/`moonshot.md`/`line/channel.ts` formatting](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/21573308125/job/62155996633)) — not related to this PR. Our `skills/humanizer/SKILL.md` passes both `oxfmt --check` and `oxlint` cleanly.
