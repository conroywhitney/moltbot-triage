## Description

## Summary

The nested ternary in `ui.js` was modified to use a switch statement for a cleaner, simpler, and easier-to-maintain solution.

## Changes

The nested ternary statements were replaced with a switch statement, which reduces nesting and is easier to maintain.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Replaced a nested ternary used to select the UI `pnpm run` script with a `switch` statement in `scripts/ui.js`, aiming to make the action-to-script mapping easier to read and extend. The rest of the script still resolves a pnpm runner, ensures UI deps are installed, and then runs `pnpm install` or `pnpm run <script>` from the `ui/` directory.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge, with one small behavior change worth addressing.
- The change is localized to `scripts/ui.js` and primarily refactors control flow, but it changes the `install` case from `script=null` to `script="install"`, which could cause subtle issues if future code relies on `script` for the install path. Formatting inconsistencies are minor but may trip lint/format checks depending on repo configuration.

**`scripts/ui.js`**
[P0] Behavior change for `install`: the previous ternary set `script = null` when `action === "install"`, but the new switch sets `script = "install"`. Even though `script` is currently unused in the `action === "install"` branch (line 129), this introduces inconsistent state and can become a bug if later code starts using `script` for install too (or if the install branch is refactored). Consider keeping `install` mapped to `null` as before, or avoid setting it at all for that case.

**`scripts/ui.js`**
[P2] This refactor introduced style/formatting inconsistencies vs the rest of the file (missing semicolons after `let script = null` and assignments; `switch(action)` spacing; trailing space in `case "dev": `). If the repo relies on formatting/lint, consider applying the existing format conventions here to avoid noise in future diffs.
