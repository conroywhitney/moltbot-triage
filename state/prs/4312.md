## Description

When the primary provider reaches quota limits, ensure fallback models from different providers are still tried.

Fixes #4260

The issue was that when all profiles for a provider were in cooldown, the code would skip that provider entirely. But this caused problems when the fallback list included models from different providers.

The fix adds a check to only skip the original provider, allowing fallback models from other providers to still be tried.
