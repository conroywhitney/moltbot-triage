## Description

## Summary
- Console log timestamps now respect the `TZ` environment variable
- Only affects `consoleStyle: "pretty"` output
- Compact, JSON, and file logs remain in UTC for tool compatibility

## Test plan
- [x] `npx vitest run src/logging/` - all 25 tests pass
- [x] Type-check passes
- [x] Lint passes
- [ ] Manual: `TZ=Asia/Tokyo npx moltbot gateway run` shows JST timestamps

Closes #3867
