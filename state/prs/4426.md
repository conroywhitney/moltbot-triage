## Description

## Summary

This PR improves the GCP deployment guide by adding:

- **Native installation option** alongside Docker for simpler personal setups
- **Tailscale integration** for secure remote access without exposing public IP
- **Cloud NAT configuration** for VMs without public IP
- **Budget alerts setup** to avoid billing surprises
- **Security checklist** with recommended file permissions
- **Telegram channel configuration** example with pairing workflow
- **Simplified structure** and improved readability
- **Updated cost estimates** (~$18/mo minimum)

## Changes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Docker-only installation | Docker + Native options |
| SSH tunnel for access | SSH tunnel + Tailscale Serve |
| No security hardening section | Security checklist + permissions |
| No budget alerts | Budget alerts with gcloud CLI |
| ~500 lines | ~500 lines (restructured) |

## Test plan

- [x] Verify all gcloud commands work
- [x] Test native installation path
- [x] Test Tailscale integration
- [x] Verify internal doc links

---

Based on production experience running OpenClaw on GCP with Tailscale.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR significantly restructures `docs/platforms/gcp.md` to cover both Docker and native installation paths, adds Tailscale-based access, removes public IP guidance (with Cloud NAT), and expands the doc with budget alerts, a security checklist/permissions, channel setup examples, troubleshooting, and an updated monthly cost estimate.

Main things to double-check are that the new “native + systemd/onboarding” instructions match what the current OpenClaw Linux CLI actually supports, and that the config/code snippets are copy/paste safe (JSON vs JSON5, OS Login + Tailscale SSH examples, permission commands).

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge, but a few doc instructions are likely to mislead users or fail when copy/pasted.
- Changes are documentation-only and mostly additive, but there are a couple of high-impact accuracy/security concerns (remote install via curl|bash, potentially unsupported systemd onboarding commands, and a config snippet that may not parse) that should be corrected to avoid broken deployments.

Hi @steipete ! Just installed OpenClaw to GCP and actualized the guide.
Btw, thanks for a great work.
