## Description

## Summary

This PR improves the GCP deployment guide by adding:

- **Native installation option** alongside Docker for simpler personal setups
- **Tailscale integration** for secure remote access without exposing public IP
- **Cloud NAT configuration** for VMs without public IP
- **Budget alerts setup** to avoid billing surprises
- **Security checklist** with recommended file permissions
- **Telegram channel configuration** example with pairing workflow
- **Simplified structure** and improved readability
- **Updated cost estimates** (~$18/mo minimum)

## Changes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Docker-only installation | Docker + Native options |
| SSH tunnel for access | SSH tunnel + Tailscale Serve |
| No security hardening section | Security checklist + permissions |
| No budget alerts | Budget alerts with gcloud CLI |
| ~500 lines | ~500 lines (restructured) |

## Test plan

- [x] Verify all gcloud commands work
- [x] Test native installation path
- [x] Test Tailscale integration
- [x] Verify internal doc links

---

Based on production experience running OpenClaw on GCP with Tailscale.
