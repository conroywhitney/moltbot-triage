## Description

## Summary
Add the new voices introduced with `gpt-4o-mini-tts` to `OPENAI_TTS_VOICES`:
- ballad
- cedar  
- marin
- verse

## Problem
These voices were missing from the validation list, causing `isValidOpenAIVoice()` to reject them and fall back to Edge TTS.

## Solution
Added the 4 new voices to the hardcoded list in `src/tts/tts.ts`.

## Testing
Tested with `cedar` voice - now works correctly with `gpt-4o-mini-tts`.
