## Description

Fixes #7072

## Problem
Installing plugins on Windows (e.g., \`pnpm openclaw plugins install @m1heng-clawd/feishu\`) failed with:
\`\`\`
Error: spawn EINVAL
    at ChildProcess.spawn (node:internal/child_process:421:11)
\`\`\`

## Root Cause
On Windows, \`npm\` is resolved to \`npm.cmd\` by the \`resolveCommand()\` helper. When spawning \`.cmd\` files directly without \`shell: true\`, Node.js fails with \`EINVAL\` because \`.cmd\` files are batch scripts that require cmd.exe.

## Solution
Automatically use \`shell: true\` on Windows when spawning commands with \`.cmd\` extension. This mirrors the fix in #1212 for the same issue in UI build scripts.

## Changes
- Added \`shell?: boolean\` to \`CommandOptions\`
- Modified \`runCommandWithTimeout()\` to detect \`.cmd\` extensions and use shell mode on Windows
- Allows explicit override via \`options.shell\` parameter

## Testing
- Build passes
- Unit tests pass

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR addresses Windows `spawn EINVAL` failures during plugin installs by teaching `runCommandWithTimeout` to opt into `child_process.spawn` shell mode when the resolved command ends in `.cmd`, with an explicit override via `CommandOptions.shell`. It also includes a small TypeScript inference workaround in the Pi tool adapter and adds `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore`.

The change fits into the existing process execution utilities in `src/process/exec.ts` (which already resolve Windows command names via `resolveCommand()`), extending that behavior to match how Windows batch scripts (`*.cmd`) must be invoked.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and fixes a real Windows spawn failure, with moderate risk around shell-mode argument quoting on Windows.
- The functional change is small and localized, but enabling `shell: true` can subtly change argument parsing/escaping behavior on Windows (and interacts with `windowsVerbatimArguments`), so Windows plugin install paths with spaces/special chars deserve a quick sanity check.
- src/process/exec.ts (shell-mode behavior on Windows)
