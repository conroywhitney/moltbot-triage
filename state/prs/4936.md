## Description

Add `ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ENETUNREACH`, and `EHOSTUNREACH` to timeout error mapping to allow proper failover on inaccessible LLMs.

Fixes openclaw/openclaw#4921

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR expands the set of Node-style network error codes that are treated as a failover-worthy `"timeout"` in `resolveFailoverReasonFromError`, enabling failover when a provider is unreachable (e.g., connection refused, DNS failures, or network unreachable). A small unit test update verifies the new mapping for `ECONNREFUSED`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge; it’s a small, localized behavior change with minimal surface area.
- The change is confined to expanding a hardcoded allowlist of error codes and adds a basic test. The main risk is semantic (treating some non-timeout network failures as "timeout"), but this aligns with the PR intent (trigger failover on unreachable providers).
- src/agents/failover-error.ts (ensure error-code semantics match desired failover policy)
