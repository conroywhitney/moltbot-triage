## Description

The current bash URL is wrong. We should either merge this now or actually rename the repo.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Updates the Ansible quick-start `curl | bash` command in `docs/install/ansible.md` to point at a different GitHub raw URL for `install.sh`.

This fits into the docs set under `docs/install/` by providing a one-liner install entrypoint for the separate Ansible deployment repo; however, the rest of the page still references `openclaw-ansible` as the canonical repository, so the quick-start URL should be aligned with the repo/link text used elsewhere in the same guide.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is low risk but the docs change likely needs alignment with other references on the same page.
- Only a documentation URL changed, so merge risk is low. The main concern is correctness: the quick-start script source now conflicts with the repo name and other links in the guide, which will confuse users or send them to the wrong installer.
- docs/install/ansible.md
