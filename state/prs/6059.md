## Description

Fixes #6044

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes an interactive CLI edge case in `models auth add` where cancelling a `@clack/prompts` select (ESC) returns `undefined` and previously flowed into provider/method handling. The command now detects cancellation for both the provider and method selects and exits early with a `Cancelled.` log, preventing downstream errors.

It also adds a small Vitest regression test that mocks `@clack/prompts` to verify the command resolves without throwing when the provider select or method select is cancelled.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge and addresses a clear cancellation crash path in an interactive command.
- The behavior change is narrow (early returns on `undefined` selections) and covered by a focused regression test. The only nits are test robustness/type-safety improvements; no functional regressions were identified in the modified command logic.
