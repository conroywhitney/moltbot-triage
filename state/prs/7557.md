## Description

## Summary

Fixes #6130 — Audio files (especially Telegram voice messages) arriving with incorrect `text/plain` MIME type are no longer embedded as binary garbage in the session context.

## Problem

Telegram voice messages arrive with `mime="text/plain"` instead of `audio/ogg`. The current code's `text/*` filter accepts these, causing:
- **448 KB** of binary data embedded per 13-second voice note
- **200k-600k tokens** of garbage when tokenized
- Exceeds Claude's 200k context limit → silent delivery failures

## Solution

Check file extensions before allowing `text/*` MIME types through:

1. Added `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS` constant with known audio extensions (`.ogg`, `.opus`, `.mp3`, etc.)
2. Added `hasAudioExtension()` helper function
3. Skip files with audio extensions in `extractFileBlocks()`, even if MIME says `text/*`

The audio still gets processed by the media-understanding audio pipeline (transcription) — it just won't be incorrectly embedded as text.

## Changes

- `src/media-understanding/apply.ts`: Add extension-based guard for audio files

## Testing

- Files with audio extensions and `text/plain` MIME are now skipped with verbose log
- Normal text files still work as expected
- Audio transcription pipeline unaffected

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds an extension-based guard in `src/media-understanding/apply.ts` to prevent audio files that arrive mislabeled as `text/*` (e.g., Telegram voice notes with `text/plain`) from being embedded into the session context as text. It introduces a set of known audio extensions and a helper (`hasAudioExtension`) that causes such attachments to be skipped during `extractFileBlocks()`, leaving audio handling to the media-understanding audio transcription pipeline.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is reasonably safe to merge and addresses a real context-bloat issue, with a small amount of edge-case risk around filename/URL parsing.
- Change is localized and defensive, but the new extension-based check depends on `nameHint` (which may be a URL/path rather than a clean filename). If querystrings/fragments are present, the guard may fail to catch the problematic Telegram case; if a misleading extension appears in a URL, it may skip otherwise-valid text attachments.
- src/media-understanding/apply.ts (nameHint/URL handling in hasAudioExtension guard)
