## Description

## Summary

Upgrade GitHub Actions to their latest versions for improved features, bug fixes, and security updates.

## Changes

| Action | Old Version(s) | New Version | Release | Files |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `actions/create-github-app-token` | [`v1`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token/releases/tag/v1) | [`v2`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token/releases/tag/v2) | [Release](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token/releases/tag/v2) | auto-response.yml, labeler.yml |
| `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` | [`v4`](https://github.com/gradle/actions/setup-gradle/releases/tag/v4) | [`v5`](https://github.com/gradle/actions/setup-gradle/releases/tag/v5) | [Release](https://github.com/gradle/actions/setup-gradle/releases/tag/v5) | ci.yml |

## Why upgrade?

Keeping GitHub Actions up to date ensures:
- **Security**: Latest security patches and fixes
- **Features**: Access to new functionality and improvements
- **Compatibility**: Better support for current GitHub features
- **Performance**: Optimizations and efficiency improvements

### Security Note

Actions that were previously pinned to commit SHAs remain pinned to SHAs (updated to the latest release SHA) to maintain the security benefits of immutable references.

### Testing

These changes only affect CI/CD workflow configurations and should not impact application functionality. The workflows should be tested by running them on a branch before merging.
