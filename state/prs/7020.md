## Description

When there are many models (>15), users can now type a search query to filter models by provider, id, name, or alias before selecting. This makes it much easier to find specific models without scrolling through a long list.

## Changes

- Added search prompt in `promptDefaultModel()` for single model selection
- Added search prompt in `promptModelAllowlist()` for multi-select model allowlist
- Search matches against provider, model id, name, and aliases
- If no matches found, shows all models again with a note

## Why

Previously, users had to scroll through potentially hundreds of models one by one when running `openclaw configure`. This was especially painful with providers like OpenRouter that have 100+ models.

## How it works

When there are more than 15 models to choose from, the wizard now shows a text prompt first:
```
Search models (127 available, type to filter by name, provider, or alias)
> claude
```

Then only matching models are shown in the select list.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a “search before select” flow to the configure wizard’s model selection paths, prompting the user for a query when the available model list is large and then filtering models by provider/id/name/aliases before showing the select/multiselect list.

The changes are localized to the CLI wizard model picker (`src/commands/model-picker.ts`) plus a small addition to the prompter type definitions (`src/wizard/prompts.ts`). The intent is to improve usability when providers expose many models (e.g., 100+), reducing scrolling in `openclaw configure`.

<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>

- This PR is not safe to merge as-is due to a TypeScript redeclaration error in the allowlist prompt logic.
- The new search/filter logic in `promptModelAllowlist` introduces a duplicate `filteredCatalog` declaration that should fail compilation and also makes part of the search logic ineffective. The other notes are lower-severity maintainability/UX concerns.
- src/commands/model-picker.ts (promptModelAllowlist variable redeclaration and duplicated search logic)

## Comments

### @GuoxiangZu (2026-02-02)

Fixed! Removed the duplicate `filteredCatalog` declaration in `promptModelAllowlist()`.

The issue was that I had added the search-filter block twice - once at line ~393 and again at line ~484. The second declaration has been removed.

Force-pushed the fix to the same branch.

### @GuoxiangZu (2026-02-02)

[P2] Fixed!

Added `HIDDEN_ROUTER_MODELS` filter after the no-matches reset:

```typescript
// Filter out hidden router models so models[0] always corresponds to an option
models = models.filter((entry) => !HIDDEN_ROUTER_MODELS.has(modelKey(entry.provider, entry.id)));
```

This ensures that when search yields no matches and we reset to show all models, the `models` array won't contain hidden router models like `openrouter/auto`, so `models[0]` (used for `initialValue`) will always point to a valid option.
