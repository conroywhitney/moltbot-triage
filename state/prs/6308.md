## Description

## Summary
- Persist log level filters in browser session storage.
- User log filter preferences (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal) now persist across browser sessions, improving user experience by maintaining their preferred log visibility settings.

## Changes
- Storage: Add logsLevelFilters field to UiSettings with proper validation and backward compatibility.
- State Management: Initialize log filters from stored settings instead of hardcoded defaults.
- Persistence: Save filter changes immediately when users toggle log levels in the UI.

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new `logsLevelFilters` field to persisted UI settings and wires the Logs view so toggling log levels immediately saves the updated filter state to storage. It also removes the now-redundant hardcoded default log filter constant, and includes minor housekeeping changes (.gitignore IDE entry, docstring typo fix).

Main integration points are `ui/src/ui/storage.ts` for default + validation/merge of persisted settings, and `ui/src/ui/app-render.ts`/`ui/src/ui/app.ts` for reading and writing the filter state during UI interactions.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is generally safe to merge; the main concern is potential state drift between `settings.logsLevelFilters` and the separate `logsLevelFilters` state field.
- Changes are localized and mostly additive (storage schema + UI wiring). However, initializing `logsLevelFilters` once from `settings` creates a plausible inconsistency if settings are updated through other code paths, which could lead to confusing UI behavior.
