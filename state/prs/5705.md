## Description

## Problem
Venice model discovery was occasionally timing out with:
```
[venice-models] Discovery failed: TimeoutError: The operation was aborted due to timeout, using static catalog
```

## Changes
1. **Increased timeout**: 5s → 15s (more headroom for slow connections)
2. **Retry logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1-5s delay, 20% jitter)
3. **In-memory caching**: 1 hour TTL, reduces API calls after first success
4. **Better error messages**: Distinguishes retry exhaustion from single failures

## Note
The Venice API typically responds in <1s, so the timeout rarely triggers. But when it does (network hiccups, cold starts), this provides graceful recovery instead of falling back to the static catalog.

## Testing
- Discovery works (~800ms first call)
- Cache works (0ms subsequent calls)
- Build passes

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds resilience improvements in two main areas:

- **Gateway channel lifecycle** (`src/gateway/server-channels.ts`): tracks per-account start time and restart attempts, and introduces an auto-restart mechanism with exponential backoff + jitter, plus a maximum restart-attempt cap and timer cancellation to avoid restart races.
- **Telegram client configuration** (`src/telegram/bot.ts`): sets a default grammY API timeout of 60 seconds (overridable via config) and simplifies `Bot` construction so the client options are always passed consistently.

A new `skills/qmd` submodule pointer is also included in the changeset.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Reasonably safe to merge, but there are a couple of restart-path edge cases that can leave channels wedged or give up too aggressively.
- Most changes are localized and straightforward, but the new auto-restart logic has two failure modes: synchronous `startAccount` throws can bypass cleanup, and restart-attempt accounting can exhaust even on non-error exits. Both could impact gateway availability if hit by certain channel implementations.

**`src/gateway/server-channels.ts`**
[P1] `startChannel` can leave the runtime stuck in `running: true` if `startAccount` throws synchronously.

`store.aborts.set` + `setRuntime(...running: true...)` happen before `startAccount(...)` is invoked. If a plugin’s `startAccount` throws synchronously (instead of returning a rejected promise), the `Promise.resolve(task).catch(...).finally(...)` chain is never created and the store entries won’t be cleaned up. Consider wrapping the `startAccount` call so synchronous exceptions flow into the same tracked promise cleanup.

Location: `src/gateway/server-channels.ts:159-206`.
