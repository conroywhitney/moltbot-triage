## Description

## Summary
- Adds missing `Provider: "telegram"` field to native commands context

## Problem
Native commands like `/elevated` were failing with:
```
elevated is not available right now (runtime=sandboxed).
Failing gates: provider (ctx.Provider)
```

The context object set `Surface` and `OriginatingChannel` to "telegram" but was missing `Provider`, which is required by `resolveElevatedPermissions()` in `reply-elevated.ts`.

## Test plan
- [ ] Run `/elevated` command in Telegram DM
- [ ] Verify elevated mode can be enabled without provider gate error

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR fixes Telegram native command execution by adding the missing `Provider: "telegram"` field to the context object built in `src/telegram/bot-native-commands.ts`. This aligns Telegram’s native-command context with other channel implementations and unblocks permission-gated commands like `/elevated`, which rely on `ctx.Provider` during `resolveElevatedPermissions()` evaluation.

<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>

- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk.
- The change is a single-field addition to an existing context object, matching established patterns in other providers and directly addressing the reported gating failure. No behavioral impact beyond enabling provider-gated native commands on Telegram is expected.
- No files require special attention
