## Description

## Summary
- Adds missing `Provider: "telegram"` field to native commands context

## Problem
Native commands like `/elevated` were failing with:
```
elevated is not available right now (runtime=sandboxed).
Failing gates: provider (ctx.Provider)
```

The context object set `Surface` and `OriginatingChannel` to "telegram" but was missing `Provider`, which is required by `resolveElevatedPermissions()` in `reply-elevated.ts`.

## Test plan
- [ ] Run `/elevated` command in Telegram DM
- [ ] Verify elevated mode can be enabled without provider gate error
