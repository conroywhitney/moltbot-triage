## Description

## Motivation                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
When first trying Moltbot on a remote VM connected via WireGuard, I had trouble understanding how to bind the gateway. Using `--bind lan` exposes it on all interfaces, but I wanted to restrict access to just the WireGuard network for better security.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
This adds a wireguard bind mode (similar to the existing tailnet mode for Tailscale) that automatically detects and binds to WireGuard mesh interfaces.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
## Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

-   Adds wireguard bind mode for WireGuard-based mesh VPNs (Netbird, Headscale, Firezone, plain WireGuard)                                                                                                                           
-   Detects wg* and wt* interfaces automatically                                                                                                                                                                                     
-   Falls back to loopback if no WireGuard interface is found                                                                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
## Test plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

-   Tested with Netbird (wt0 interface) on Linux ARM64                                                                                                                                                                               
-   Gateway binds to WireGuard IP and is accessible from mesh peers                                                                                                                                                                  
-   Fallback to loopback works when no WireGuard interface present
