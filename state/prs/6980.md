## Description

## Summary

- Adds `vet-skill` - a security vetting protocol for scanning new skills before installation
- Updates `docs/tools/skills.md` security notes to reference the new skill

## What vet-skill does

Scans skills for:
- **API key exfiltration** - patterns like `curl.*$.*_KEY`, credential file access
- **Prompt injection** - "ignore previous instructions", identity redefinition attempts
- **Malicious code** - `rm -rf`, reverse shells, `eval base64`, etc.
- **Data exfiltration** - SSH key access, history file reads
- **Social engineering** - urgency tactics, fake authorization claims

## Usage

```
/vet-skill https://example.com/skill.md
```

The skill will:
1. Fetch and analyze the skill content
2. Scan for threat patterns
3. Analyze holistically (scope creep, obfuscation, excessive permissions)
4. Log approval/rejection to `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/skill-vetting.log`

## Why this matters

Skills have access to environment variables, can execute code, and run in the host process. A malicious skill could:
- Steal API keys and impersonate the agent
- Access sensitive files
- Execute arbitrary code

The existing security guidance ("Treat third-party skills as untrusted code. Read them before enabling.") is good advice but doesn't provide a structured process. This skill gives agents a concrete vetting protocol.

## Test plan

- [ ] Install skill and invoke `/vet-skill` on a known-safe skill
- [ ] Test with a skill containing obvious red flags (exfiltration patterns)
- [ ] Verify logging works correctly

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

Adds a new bundled skill `vet-skill` that provides a structured checklist/process for reviewing third-party skills for common threat patterns (prompt injection, exfiltration, malicious commands, social engineering) before installing them. Updates the skills documentation to recommend running `vet-skill` as part of the security guidance.

The change fits into the existing skills system by adding another user-invocable slash command under `skills/` that teaches agents a consistent vetting protocol, and linking to it from `docs/tools/skills.md` so users discover it alongside the existing “treat skills as untrusted code” advice.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- This PR is mostly safe to merge, but the new skill’s recommended workflow includes risky host-side actions that undercut the goal of safer vetting.
- Changes are isolated to docs + a new skill markdown. Main concerns are about the security posture/UX of the vetting protocol (fetching untrusted content via curl, and a brittle SKILL_NAME extraction that can lead to incorrect installs/logging). No runtime code paths in the app are modified, so blast radius is limited to users following the instructions.
- skills/vet-skill/SKILL.md (vetting workflow safety and robustness); docs/tools/skills.md (arg/log path consistency)
