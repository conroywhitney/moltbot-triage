## Description

## Summary

Increase chat textarea `max-height` from 150px to `min(400px, 50vh)` so users can see more of their message while typing instead of scrolling in a tiny box.

The textarea currently limits to ~3 lines before requiring internal scrolling, making it hard to compose longer messages.

## Changes

- CSS only: `max-height: min(400px, 50vh)` in `ui/src/styles/chat/layout.css`

This allows the textarea to grow up to 400px or 50% of viewport height (whichever is smaller), preserving usability on both large and small screens.

## Testing

- [x] Tested locally with long messages (20+ lines)
- [x] Verified textarea expands without internal scroll until limit
- [x] Chat thread remains scrollable above
- [x] CI passes (lint, format, build)

## Screenshots

Before: Textarea limited to ~3 lines, requires internal scrolling
After: Textarea expands to show more content

## CI Failure Analysis

The failing test is unrelated to this PR's CSS change:

**Failing test:** `src/media-understanding/apply.test.ts` > "escapes XML special characters in filenames to prevent injection"

**Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\moltbot-media-EAcbZa\file<test>.txt'`

**Root cause:** This test runs on the Windows CI runner and attempts to create a file with `<` and `>` characters in the filename, which are invalid on Windows filesystems. The test is designed to verify XML character escaping, but ironically cannot execute on Windows because of the test filename itself.

**This PR only changes:**
- `ui/src/styles/chat/layout.css`: `max-height: 150px` → `max-height: min(400px, 50vh)`

This is a pre-existing test infrastructure issue, not caused by this PR.
