## Description

I created an architecture diagram with areas of the lethal trifecta identified to help users visualize how AI exploits can occur.

<!-- greptile_comment -->

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR adds a new “Architecture Diagram” section to the README and introduces a PNG diagram under `assets/` to illustrate where “lethal trifecta” risk areas can occur in the system.

The change is isolated to documentation/asset updates (no runtime code changes). The main concerns are around the new image asset handling in git and small README wording/accessibility details.

<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>

- Mostly safe to merge (docs-only), but image git attributes should be fixed to avoid asset corruption.
- Changes are limited to README + a static PNG, so behavioral risk is low. However, the PNG currently appears to be tracked with `text: auto`, which can cause incorrect filtering in some environments; addressing that would make this PR clearly safe.

**`assets/moltbot-architecture-diagram.png`**
[P1] PNG is tracked as text (missing binary/LFS attributes)

`git check-attr` shows `assets/moltbot-architecture-diagram.png: text: auto`, which can cause line-ending filters or diffs to treat the PNG as text in some environments and lead to corruption. This file should be marked binary (and possibly handled via Git LFS if the repo uses it for images).

Also appears in: `assets/moltbot-architecture-diagram.png:1` (entire file).

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
