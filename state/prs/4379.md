## Description

## Summary
Add support for configuring human-readable names for Telegram forum topics, so the agent can understand the context of the conversation better.

## Changes
- Add `name` field to `TelegramTopicConfig` for human-readable topic names
- Update `buildGroupLabel` to display topic name instead of just ID when configured
- Add `TopicName` field to `MsgContext` for agent visibility
- Update Zod schema for config validation

## Configuration Example
```yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    groups:
      "-1234567890":
        topics:
          "37":
            name: "General Discussion"
          "42":
            name: "Tech Support"
```

## Result
With this configuration, the agent will see conversation context like:
- Before: `[Telegram MyGroup id:-1234567890 topic:37 ...]`
- After: `[Telegram MyGroup id:-1234567890 topic:General Discussion ...]`

This helps the agent understand what topic it's in without needing to look up topic IDs.

## Testing
- Type checked with `tsc --noEmit`
- Manually verified module imports work
