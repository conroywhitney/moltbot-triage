## Description

## Summary

Adds a new `install:hackable` npm script that enables a "hackable installation" workflow for users who want to clone openclaw, customize it for their needs, and have their changes immediately available system-wide.

## What is a "Hackable Install"?

This is for users who:
1. Want to clone the openclaw repository (so agents have full context of the codebase)
2. Make local modifications to suit their specific needs
3. Have those changes immediately available via the `openclaw` command
4. Potentially submit PRs back if they improve something

## What it does

Running `pnpm run install:hackable` will:
1. Build the project (same as `pnpm run build`)
2. Link openclaw globally via `pnpm link --global`
3. Make the `openclaw` CLI available from anywhere in your terminal
4. Enable shell completion support

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git ~/openclaw
cd ~/openclaw

# Run the hackable install
pnpm run install:hackable

# Now openclaw is available globally with your local changes
openclaw --help
openclaw completion --shell zsh >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Changes

- Added `"install:hackable": "pnpm build && pnpm link --global"` to `package.json` scripts
- Follows the project's `install:*` naming convention (e.g., `android:install`)

## 🤖 Prompt to Generate This PR

If you want an AI assistant to generate this same PR, use this prompt:

```
I want to add an 'install:hackable' script to the openclaw package.json that enables a "hackable installation" workflow.

A hackable install is for users who want to:
1. Clone the openclaw repo (so agents have full codebase context)
2. Make local modifications to suit their needs
3. Have the 'openclaw' command available globally with their changes
4. Potentially submit PRs if they improve something

The script should:
1. Run the existing build command
2. Link the package globally using pnpm link --global
3. Follow the project's install:* naming convention

Please:
1. Add the script to package.json as "install:hackable"
2. Run pnpm run format:fix to ensure CI format checks pass
3. Create a branch called feat/install-hackable-script
4. Commit with a descriptive message explaining the feature
5. Push to a fork (since I don't have direct write access)
6. Create a PR against openclaw/openclaw main branch
7. Include this exact prompt in the PR description so others can regenerate it

The PR title should be: feat: add install:hackable script for hackable installs
```

**Note for maintainers:** This is a developer-experience improvement with no runtime changes. The script is optional and doesn't affect existing workflows.
