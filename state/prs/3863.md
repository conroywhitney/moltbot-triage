## Description

fixes: #3773 
 ## Summary                                                                                                                                                            
  - Mount config volume at `/home/node/.moltbot` instead of `/home/node/.clawdbot` in both gateway and CLI services                                                     
  - Set `MOLTBOT_STATE_DIR` env var so the app resolves to the mounted path                                                                                             
  - Update `docker-setup.sh` defaults and extra-compose paths to match                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                        
  Fixes device pairing not persisting across container restarts — the app was ignoring the `.moltbot` mount and creating a new `.clawdbot` directory.                   
                                                                                                                                                                        
  **Note:** Container-internal path change only. Host-side volume (`$CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_DIR`) is unchanged — no migration needed for existing deployments.
