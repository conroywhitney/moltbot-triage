## Description

## Summary
WhatsApp voice messages require OGG/Opus format to play correctly. Previously, only Telegram received Opus output while WhatsApp got MP3, causing "something is wrong with the audio" errors on playback.

## Changes
- `resolveOutputFormat()`: Include `whatsapp` in Opus output channels  
- `shouldVoice`: Include `whatsapp` for voice message delivery

## Testing
Tested locally with ElevenLabs TTS → WhatsApp. Voice messages now play correctly.

Fixes #6491

<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>

<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>

This PR updates TTS channel handling so WhatsApp receives Opus output (matching Telegram’s voice-note-friendly settings) and marks WhatsApp TTS media as `audioAsVoice` when the produced audio is voice-compatible.

The change is localized to `src/tts/tts.ts` by extending `resolveOutputFormat()` and the `shouldVoice` decision in `maybeApplyTtsToPayload()`, aligning the media format/flagging with WhatsApp’s voice-message playback requirements.

<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>

- This PR is likely safe to merge and narrowly scoped, with minor format/compatibility risk depending on WhatsApp’s expected container/MIME handling.
- Changes are small and confined to channel-specific branching for output format selection and voice-message delivery. Main uncertainty is whether reusing Telegram’s `.opus` container/extension is sufficient for WhatsApp, which may require OGG/Opus semantics beyond just using an Opus codec.
