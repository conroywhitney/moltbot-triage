## Description

### Summary
Integrated Homebrew (Linuxbrew) into the Docker environment to enable seamless installation of additional binaries and skills. This update also includes security hardening by switching to the non-root node user and standardizing on the clawdbot naming convention across the codebase.

### Changes
Updated Dockerfile to install Homebrew during the build process.

### Usage
Once the container is running, you can verify Homebrew is available by executing:

```
bash
docker exec <container_id> brew --version
```
The agent can now be instructed to install tools using brew in cli and webUI, for example:
```
bash
# Example: Install jq inside the container
brew install jq
```
