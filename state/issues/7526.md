## Description

## Summary
The Telegram channel plugin stops receiving messages after ~8 minutes when the long-polling connection times out. The plugin does not auto-reconnect, requiring manual gateway restarts to restore functionality.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Configure OpenClaw with Telegram channel enabled (long-polling mode, not webhooks)
2. Start the gateway and send a test message (verify bot responds)
3. Wait ~8-10 minutes without interaction
4. Send another message to the bot
5. Observe that the bot does not respond
6. Check `openclaw status` - shows Telegram as "OK"
7. Check Telegram API `getWebhookInfo` endpoint - `pending_update_count` will be > 0

## Expected behavior
The Telegram plugin should automatically reconnect when the long-polling connection times out, maintaining continuous message delivery without manual intervention.

## Actual behavior
- Long-polling connection times out after ~500 seconds (~8.3 minutes)
- Plugin does not reconnect
- Messages queue on Telegram's side (visible as pending updates)
- `openclaw status` shows channel as "OK" (API is reachable, but polling loop is dead)
- Bot remains unresponsive until gateway is manually restarted

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: `2026.1.30`
- OS: `macOS` (likely affects all platforms)
- Install method: `pnpm` (global install)

## Logs or screenshots

No error logs are generated when polling stops. The connection silently dies without logging a failure.

After adding retry policy to config:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "retry": {
        "attempts": 5,
        "minDelayMs": 1000,
        "maxDelayMs": 10000,
        "jitter": 0.3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:** 23+ hours continuous operation, zero timeouts, zero restarts required.

## Proposed Fix

**Make retry policy the default for Telegram channel configuration.** This converts a hard failure (polling dies, manual restart needed) into a self-healing transient failure (exponential backoff reconnection).

### Suggested Default Config
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "retry": {
        "attempts": 5,
        "minDelayMs": 1000,
        "maxDelayMs": 10000,
        "jitter": 0.3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This would make the Telegram integration production-ready out of the box without requiring users to implement external health monitoring scripts.
