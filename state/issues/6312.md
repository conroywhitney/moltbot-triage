## Description

## Summary

What went wrong? It seems Openclaw is not compatible with local copilot proxy

## Steps to reproduce

1. install wsl ubuntu
2. enable vs code extention copilot proxy in wsl and have server running at 127.0.0.1:8080
3. install Openclaw on ubuntu and onboard with local copilot proxy base url 127.0.0.1:8080/v1

## Expected behavior

What did you expect to happen? The wake up my friend msg will get responses and I can start setting it up via chat

## Actual behavior

What actually happened? tui freeze, after restart it says "HTTP 400: messages[1].content must be a string or null  " to all my sent msgs

the local copilot proxy shows no record of being used by Openclaw, while I can manualy curl it and get copilot responses (i.e. server is working just fine)

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Windows 11 + WSL2 Ubuntu 24
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): tried npm tried one-liner, none works

btw, I tried installation with openai api key, works fine, so I believe the problem is just with the interface with [local copilot proxy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RatajikSoftware.vscode-copilot-proxy) itself.
