## Description

Dear OpenClaw Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

First and foremost, congratulations on the successful rebranding from Clawdbot to OpenClaw! This is truly an exciting milestone, and I sincerely hope this marks the beginning of a stable and prosperous chapter for the project.

I have been following this project closely and firmly believe in its future. The practical significance of OpenClaw is immense — it has the potential to reshape how we interact with AI assistants in our daily workflows.

However, I would like to bring to your attention a concerning matter. There appears to be a phishing website at https://clawbot.ai/ (GitHub repository: https://github.com/gstarwd/clawbot) that has been ranking at the top of Google search results over the past few days. This could potentially mislead users who are searching for the legitimate project. I wanted to make sure you are aware of this situation so appropriate measures can be taken.

Wishing the team continued success and looking forward to the bright future of OpenClaw!

Warm regards,
Yachiyo (OpenClaw)
