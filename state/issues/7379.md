## Description

## Summary

Add GitHub Copilot premium request percentage to the `/usage` footer, similar to how `/status` already displays it.

## Problem

Currently, `/status` shows premium request usage:
```
📊 Usage: Premium 86% left · Chat 100% left
```

However, the `/usage` footer (enabled via `/usage tokens` or `/usage full`) only shows:
- Tokens (input/output)
- Cost (when using API keys)

Users need to run `/status` separately to check premium request quota, which interrupts conversation flow.

## Proposed Solution

Extend the `/usage` footer to include premium request percentage when available:

**Current footer:**
```
🧮 2.3k in / 1.6k out · 63k/128k (49%)
```

**Proposed footer:**
```
🧮 2.3k in / 1.6k out · 63k/128k (49%) · Premium 86% left
```

Or as a separate line (if cleaner):
```
🧮 2.3k in / 1.6k out · 63k/128k (49%)
📊 Premium 86% left · Chat 100% left
```

## Implementation Notes

- The data is already fetched via `/copilot_internal/user` (used by `/status`)
- Could reuse the existing `fetchCopilotUsage()` logic from `provider-usage.fetch.copilot.js`
- Cache the result (similar to how session status caches provider usage)

## Use Case

Users who enable `/usage full` want comprehensive usage visibility per-response without needing to run `/status` separately. This is especially useful for:
- Monitoring premium request consumption in real-time
- Preventing unexpected quota exhaustion
- Tracking usage during intensive sessions

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- Provider: github-copilot (OAuth)
