## Description

## Summary

I'm trying to add a node that is containerized.
I'm not sure if this is possible to achieve currently.

The problem is that-
1. If I try to run `openclaw node install`, it will fail with `Node service check failed: Error: systemctl --user unavailable: unknown error`
2. If I directly `openclaw node run` without install, it will fail with `gateway connect failed: Error: pairing required`

## Proposed solution

I'd like the 'install' command to optionally skip the systemd enforcing, which is not needed in docker.
Or something like a dedicated 'pair' command.

If there is existing way this can be achieved, please let me know. Thanks!
