## Description

Description:
The OpenClaw control UI logo fails to load on fresh installation. The browser shows a broken image link pointing to:

https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg
Expected behavior:
The OpenClaw logo should load without requiring ClawHub authentication.

Actual behavior:

mintcdn.com returns HTTP 403 Forbidden
clawhub login also fails with "Unauthorized" error
New users see a broken logo on first launch
Environment:

macOS (arm64)
OpenClaw 2026.1.30
Gateway running locally on port 18789
Steps to reproduce:

Install OpenClaw via Homebrew
Run openclaw gateway start
Open http://127.0.0.1:18789/control-ui/
Observe broken logo image
Suggested fix:
Either:

Bundle the default logo locally in the OpenClaw installation
Use a publicly accessible CDN URL that doesn't require authentication

I have the same issue, was wondering why dashboard logo no longer loading.

```
