## Description

The model picker in `moltbot tui` shows every possible model (~600+) instead of filtering to:
1. Models the user has configured
2. Models the user has auth for

This makes it nearly impossible to quickly switch models.

Expected: Show only models with valid auth, with configured defaults at top.
