## Description

While trying to build Moltbot from a clean clone (following the Hetzner/Docker docs), pnpm fails during `pnpm ui:install`.

There seem to be 2 related issues, which hit at`extensions/googlechat`then elsewhere...

1. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` does not include `packages/**`, so workspace packages that live under `packages/` are invisible to pnpm.  
   This causes `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND` for valid workspace packages.

Possible fix?
```yaml
packages:
  - .
  - ui
  - extensions/*
  - packages/**
```

2. Some extensions (e.g. `extensions/memory-core`) depend on published versions of `clawdbot`:

```
"clawdbot": ">=2026.1.26"
```

During local monorepo builds this makes pnpm try to fetch from npm:

```
ERR_PNPM_NO_MATCHING_VERSION No matching version found for clawdbot@>=2026.1.26
```

This seems to be fallout from the ongoing rebrand where:
* the workspace contains both moltbot and clawdbot packages
* but pnpm is not configured to see all workspace paths
* and some packages still assume npm resolution instead of workspace resolution.
