## Description

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently, slash commands (like `/status`) are hardcoded in the channel plugins. Users and developers cannot add discoverable UI commands (e.g., `/weather`, `/jira`) without modifying the core bot source code. Skills can add tools, but they lack a way to register corresponding UI triggers.

### Describe the solution you'd like
A "Dynamic Command Registry" system where:
1. **Skill Definition:** The `AgentSkill` interface accepts an optional `commands` array (matching Discord's slash command schema).
2. **Registration:** On startup or skill load, the `SkillManager` aggregates these commands.
3. **Provider Sync:** Channel plugins (Discord, Slack) listen for these definitions and update their command lists via API.
4. **Routing:** Invoking a dynamic command (e.g., `/create-issue`) routes the intent to the agent with the specific tool context.

### Describe alternatives you've considered
- Using natural language only (current state).
- Hardcoding commands in the core (not scalable).

### Additional context
This would massively improve feature discovery for users who don't know what an installed skill is capable of.
