## Description

## Feature Request

**Is your feature request related to a problem?**

Currently, the Webchat UI is only available in English. For users who prefer other languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish, Japanese), this creates a less accessible experience.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add internationalization (i18n) support to the Webchat UI, allowing users to:
1. Select their preferred language in settings or have it auto-detect from browser locale
2. View all UI elements (buttons, labels, menus, tooltips) in their chosen language

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

- Manually editing frontend code (not practical for most users)
- Community-contributed language packs

**Additional context**

This would make OpenClaw more accessible to non-English speaking users and communities. Even starting with a few major languages (Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, German, French) would be a big improvement.
