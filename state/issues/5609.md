## Description

## Bug Description

OGG audio files contain many null bytes, which causes OpenClaw to misinterpret them as UTF-16 text. The audio content gets decoded as Chinese characters and injected into the context.

## Root Cause

In `dist/media-understanding/apply.js` (line ~179), audio files are not skipped in the early stage check — only images and videos are:

```javascript
// Current (buggy):
if (!forcedTextMime && (kind === "image" || kind === "video")) {
    continue;
}
```

## Fix

Add `audio` to the skip condition:

```javascript
// Fixed:
if (!forcedTextMime && (kind === "image" || kind === "video" || kind === "audio")) {
    continue;
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Send an OGG voice message to OpenClaw via Telegram
2. Observe the context — audio binary is decoded as UTF-16 and appears as Chinese characters

## Environment

- OpenClaw: latest (installed via `curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash`)
- Channel: Telegram
- Audio format: OGG (voice message)

## Workaround

Patch locally at line 179 of `dist/media-understanding/apply.js`
