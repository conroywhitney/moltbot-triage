## Description

## Summary

Exec approval prompts forwarded to Telegram currently require users to type commands like `/approve <id> allow-once`, which is cumbersome on mobile and error-prone.

## Proposed Enhancement

Add **inline buttons** to Telegram approval messages with the following actions:
- **Allow once**
- **Always allow**
- **Deny**

These buttons would map to the existing approval commands while providing a more streamlined UX.

## Technical Notes

- The Telegram transport already supports inline buttons (documented in message CLI/docs)
- Text-based commands should remain available for backward compatibility
- Button state should handle timeout/expiry gracefully (disable or show clear error if approval ID has expired)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Telegram approval prompt messages include inline action buttons
- Pressing a button resolves the approval with the same behavior as the corresponding `/approve` command
- Works for DMs (group chat support optional/behind feature flag)

This would significantly improve the mobile approval workflow without breaking existing functionality.
