## Description

## Problem

Google Chat webhooks only deliver messages to bots when they are @mentioned in Spaces. This makes the bot "blind" to regular conversations and severely limits its usefulness in group spaces.

## Current Behavior

- Bot receives: `ADDED_TO_SPACE`, `REMOVED_FROM_SPACE`, `MESSAGE` (only when @mentioned)
- Bot does NOT receive: Regular messages in Spaces without @mention
- Config `requireMention: false` has no effect because Google simply doesn't send the webhook

## Proposed Solution

Implement support for the **Google Workspace Events API** which allows subscribing to ALL events in a Chat Space via Pub/Sub:

- [Google Workspace Events API Overview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events)
- [Subscribe to Google Chat events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/events-chat)

This would involve:
1. Creating a Pub/Sub subscription for Chat spaces
2. Receiving events for: messages, reactions, memberships, space changes
3. Routing these events through Clawdbot's existing message pipeline

## Workaround

Currently users must @mention the bot for every message, which defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant in a group space.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Google Chat
- Space type: Group space with multiple users
