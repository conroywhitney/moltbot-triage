## Description

perhaps inherit this feature or abstraction from Rust, completely rewrite this project in Rust. Safe mode can be running ClawdBot locally in a sandbox environment with limited access and it protects user from undefined behaviour, memory leaks and root access from who knows outside, and unsafe it will be given root permission as it has now to do whatever you want at your own risk, prompt injections are bad and this shoild be #1 priority to fix. Otherwise what is the point of this project..?  Leak all user data..?

﻿## Bug perspective: No safety gate for destructive agent operations

This is framed as a feature, but the underlying issue is a **safety bug**: the agent can execute destructive commands (Remove-Item -Force, uninstall, credential revocation, database drops) without any confirmation gate.

**Observed incident:** Agent recommended removing Norton antivirus as "disk cleanup" on a 24/7 server. The server owner has a ransomware-to-bankruptcy history. If approved via quick click, the server would have been left unprotected. Remove-Item -Force bypasses the recycle bin - permanent data loss.

**Impact:** One careless approval = irreversible damage. No dry-run, no confirmation, no safety mode.

**Environment:** OpenClaw 2026.1.30, Windows 10

**Workaround:** Manual 5-point gate policy (human process, not enforced by system).

This is a safety issue, not a nice-to-have feature. Aligns with stabilisation mode (#5799).

Thank you, sir. So it is totally different from a regular program, understood.. agent communication is different that from regular computing, so how can I contribute to this stable mode of the model? Thank you in advance.
