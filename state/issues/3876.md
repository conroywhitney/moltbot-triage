## Description

### Description

This issue is to align with maintainers **before submitting any large PRs**, per feedback on #3026.

I’d like to propose an **opt-in, pluggable long-term memory backend** along with a **centralized PII-masking hook** that applies before data is written to session logs. The intent is to address current limitations in the existing memory implementation while keeping changes modular, reviewable, and non-breaking.

The proposal is **discussion-only** at this stage — no code changes are implied by this issue.

#### Motivation

The current memory system has a few known constraints:

* Destructive compaction that can lose conversation history
* Limited recall (no semantic or hybrid search)
* Session logs may store sensitive data in plaintext

The goal is to improve memory quality and privacy guarantees without replacing or breaking existing behavior.

#### Proposed scope (separable components)

* **Alternative memory backend (opt-in)**
  Lives under `extensions/`, coexists with the current memory plugin, and can be enabled via config.
* **Global PII masking hook**
  Masks common sensitive data (e.g., emails, phone numbers, API keys) before persistence to session logs, tool calls, and assistant output.
* **Optional memory capabilities**
  Hybrid (semantic + lexical) search, RAG-style querying, and configurable auto-capture / auto-recall.

Each of these would be implemented as **small, focused PRs** only after agreement on approach.

#### Non-goals

* No breaking changes
* No forced migration from the existing memory system
* No default behavior changes without explicit enablement

#### Questions for maintainers

* Is an opt-in secondary memory backend acceptable?
* Is a centralized PII-masking layer aligned with project direction?
* Should advanced search be standardized or treated as optional capability?
* Any concerns with external SDK dependencies for memory backends?

Feedback on scope and direction would help determine whether and how to proceed with smaller follow-up PRs.
