## Description

## Summary
The webchat UI currently renders `MEDIA:/path/to/file.mp3` as plain text instead of an embedded audio player.

## Current behavior
- Agent outputs `MEDIA:/tmp/tts-xxx/voice.mp3`
- Webchat shows the raw text
- User has to use external tunnels to access the file

## Expected behavior
- Webchat detects `MEDIA:` paths in assistant messages
- Renders `<audio>` or `<video>` elements with playback controls
- Gateway serves files via an authenticated endpoint

## Use case
TTS responses should play directly in webchat.
