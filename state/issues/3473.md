## Description

## Bug Description

On Windows, the webchat Control UI displays empty message bubbles after the agent completes. The bot name and timestamp appear (e.g., "AdamaBot2 8:39 AM") but **no response text is rendered**.

## Environment

- **OS:** Windows 11 (10.0.26200 x64)
- **Node:** 22.16.0
- **Clawdbot:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Browser:** Chrome (latest)

## Evidence

### Logs show agent completes successfully:
```
2026-01-28T16:29:26.285Z debug agent/embedded embedded run done: runId=56919af1... durationMs=48579 aborted=false
2026-01-28T16:29:26.291Z debug diagnostic lane task done: lane=main durationMs=48585 active=0 queued=0
```

### UI shows empty response:
- Bot name + timestamp appear
- Message bubble is empty (no text content)
- Health indicator shows "OK" (green)

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start gateway on Windows: `clawdbot gateway`
2. Open Control UI: `http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat`
3. Send a message (e.g., "What is 2+2?")
4. Wait for agent to complete (~30-60s)
5. Observe: bot name/timestamp appear but response text is missing

## Workaround

Use Telegram channel instead of webchat - Telegram works correctly.

## Possible Causes

1. **Streaming mode issue** - `streamMode: "partial"` may cause incomplete renders
2. **WebSocket timing** - Connection may drop after agent completes but before response streams
3. **session-memory hook aftermath** - We disabled the hook (ESM loader path bug #2914?) but session state may be corrupted
4. **UI rendering bug** - Frontend fails to parse/display certain response formats

- May be related to ESM loader path bug (Windows paths not converted to `file:///` URLs)
- session-memory hook was disabled as workaround but issue persists
