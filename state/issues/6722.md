## Description

## Feature Request

When sending messages with URLs via WhatsApp, the link preview (thumbnail + title) is not generated.

## Technical Details

Baileys already supports this via the `generateHighQualityLinkPreview` option in `makeWASocket`:

```javascript
// Current code in dist/web/session.js (line 75):
const sock = makeWASocket({
    auth: {...},
    version,
    logger,
    browser: ["clawdbot", "cli", VERSION],
    syncFullHistory: false,
    markOnlineOnConnect: false,
});

// Suggested addition:
const sock = makeWASocket({
    // ... existing options ...
    generateHighQualityLinkPreview: true,
    linkPreviewImageThumbnailWidth: 300,  // optional
});
```

Baileys has the `getUrlInfo` function in `lib/Utils/link-preview.js` which is already imported and used in `messages-send.js`.

## Expected Behavior

When sending a YouTube link (or any URL), WhatsApp should display the rich preview with thumbnail and title, similar to when typing manually in the WhatsApp app.

## Current Behavior

Links are sent as plain text without preview.

## Use Case

Sending workout videos with nice previews instead of plain URLs.
