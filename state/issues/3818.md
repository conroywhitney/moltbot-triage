Similarly, I keep running into this issue when moving from local to the cloud.

I'm encountering this issue as well. It seems to be caused by the model failing to return a response. I suggest adding a clear error message or prompt to the user when this happens, so they know the request failed instead of getting no feedback.

Once it was fixed, when I swapped MinMax for Qwen, the messages started showing up—no idea why.

I managed to fix the "no response" issue. It turns out that MiniMax uses different API endpoints for its International and Chinese versions.

If you are using a Chinese API Key, the default base URL in Clawdbot is incorrect. You need to manually override the baseUrl in your configuration file.

Solution: Edit your ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json and update the minimax configuration as follows:

JSON

"minimax": {
  "baseUrl": "https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic"
}
Chinese: 我也遇到了发消息不回复的问题，排查发现是因为 MiniMax 的 API 分为国内版和国际版。如果你使用的是国内申请的 API Key，默认的接口地址是无法调通的。只需要在配置文件 clawdbot.json 中将 baseUrl 改为国内地址即可解决。
