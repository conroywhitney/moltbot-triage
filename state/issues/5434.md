## Description

Running as root on Linux: ./docker-setup.sh

Doesn't create this directory before accessing it.
Changing the workspace directory in manual mode still wants to access /home/node/ for any reason.

## Comments

### @Buckler89 (2026-01-31)

I'm having the same issue using docker-setup.sh

### @sausix (2026-01-31)

Looks like the installer is using variables like $HOME from the host environment for the docker container.
There should just be volumes and mount points within the container.

Almost a new issue every minute. This project has to settle down first and test new features before publishing.

### @technet365 (2026-01-31)

fast way:
chown -R 1000:1000 "$HOME/.openclaw"

#or add in docker-setup.sh:
#after lines:
mkdir -p "$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR"
mkdir -p "$OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR"

#this:
chown -R 1000:1000 "$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR"

Thank @technet365. It's working !

I get this, I guess it's similar:
```

Seems there is a difference if the user is in the sudo group or not. Currently it seems the user must be in the sudo group

### @humblecoder (2026-02-02)

IMO, the call needs to reference a "local" (inside the project folder) mount.  Or at the very least, respect the .env.  It appears that the current ./docker-setup.sh doesn't respect that particular `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR` setting, and it ends up getting overwritten.  Not a fan of dockerized apps writing config items to my home directory.
