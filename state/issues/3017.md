## Description

## Problem

The TUI uses gray/dim ANSI colors that are hard to read on light terminal backgrounds (e.g., Warp in light mode). The low-contrast text becomes nearly invisible.

## Suggested Solutions

1. **CLI flag**: `clawdbot tui --theme light|dark|auto`
2. **Config option**: `ui.tui.theme` or `ui.tui.colorScheme`
3. **Auto-detection**: Respect `COLORFGBG` or similar env vars to detect light/dark terminal
4. **Higher contrast defaults**: Use brighter colors for dim text that work on both light and dark backgrounds

## Environment

- Terminal: Warp (light mode)
- OS: macOS
- The gray text for timestamps, tool output headers, and secondary info is particularly hard to read

## Workaround

Currently using `NO_COLOR=1 clawdbot tui` but this removes all styling.
