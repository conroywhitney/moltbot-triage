## Description

Problem
- Using the ClawdHub CLI, token verification / publish can fail with Unauthorized when the configured registry base URL redirects.

Observed
- When the registry is set to `https://clawhub.ai` (no www), it redirects to `https://www.clawhub.ai`.
- On redirect, the HTTP client appears to drop the `Authorization` header, so the final request hits the destination without the token -> Unauthorized.

Fix / workaround
- Configure the registry base to the final URL directly (e.g. `https://www.clawhub.ai`) to avoid redirects.

Expected
- Follow redirects while preserving Authorization header (or re-apply auth on redirect), or disallow redirecting registry bases with a clear error.
