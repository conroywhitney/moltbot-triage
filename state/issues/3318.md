## Description

## Summary - cron & timezone issue
I ran into an issue with cron functionality. I ran Moltbot on a VPS in a different timezone, and AI get confused about cron scheduling. If i set the correct timezone after the onboard process not solved the problem. But if i set my local timezone on the vps before the onboarding, it solves the issue. It would be nice to ask the user for timezone information in the install script to prevent misbehaviour.

## Proposed solution
It would be nice to ask the user for timezone information in the install script to prevent incorrect cron scheduling.

Good news - there's a PR addressing this!

**PR:** #3339 - feat(onboard): Add timezone prompt to onboarding wizard

Also related:
- #3329 - feat: use userTimezone as default for cron schedules

These two PRs together should provide a complete solution for timezone-aware cron scheduling.
