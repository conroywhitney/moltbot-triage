## Description

### Problem Description
When running OpenClaw, attempts to read the `AGENTS.md` file (both via the `read` tool and `exec cat AGENTS.md`) consistently return the JSON content of `memory/heartbeat-state.json` instead of the actual Markdown content of `AGENTS.md`. This occurs despite the `AGENTS.md` file being present and correctly formatted on disk (verified by user via `vi`).

This internal misinterpretation of `AGENTS.md` prevents the agent from correctly adhering to its core operational instructions and new protocols placed within that file.

### Context
This issue is observed in an environment that was recently migrated from Clawdbot to OpenClaw, running on macOS (Arm64).

### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Ensure OpenClaw Gateway is running on macOS (Arm64), potentially after a migration from Clawdbot.
2.  From within an agent session, execute a command to read `AGENTS.md`:
    *   `print(default_api.read(path = "AGENTS.md"))`
    *   Or: `print(default_api.exec(command = "cat AGENTS.md"))`
3.  Observe the output.

### Expected Behavior
The `read` or `exec cat` command for `AGENTS.md` should return the Markdown text content of the `AGENTS.md` file.

### Actual Behavior
The `read` or `exec cat` command for `AGENTS.md` returns the JSON content of `memory/heartbeat-state.json`, specifically:
'''json
{"lastChecks": {"calendar": 1703260800, "email": 1703275200, "weather": null}}
'''
(Timestamp values may vary, but the structure is consistent with `heartbeat-state.json`).

Other Markdown files, such as `USER.md`, can be read correctly by the agent's tools.

### System Details
*   OpenClaw Version: `2026.1.29 (a5b4d22)`
*   Operating System: `macOS (Arm64)`

### Additional Notes
This bug severely impairs the agent's ability to self-manage based> on its core `AGENTS.md` instructions, as its internal perception of> the file's content is incorrect.
