## Description

## Problem Description

When spawning sub-agents with models that don't support tool calling, OpenClaw fails silently instead of providing clear error feedback to the user or parent session.

## Current Behavior

### Non-tool-supporting models (e.g., ollama/llama3:8b)
- Model returns error: 
- Error is NOT surfaced to the parent session or user
- Sub-agent produces empty response or falls back silently
- No indication that the model selection caused the failure

### Malformed tool calling (e.g., llama3.1:8b via Ollama)
- Model generates tool descriptions in plain text instead of proper JSON
- Response looks like tool calling but isn't parseable
- No clear error about malformed tool call format
- Debugging becomes extremely difficult

## Expected Behavior

1. **Error propagation**: Tool calling errors from sub-agents should be surfaced to the spawning session
2. **Clear feedback**: Users should know when their model choice is incompatible
3. **Graceful handling**: Better error messages when tool call format is malformed

## Suggested Fixes

1. **Surface sub-agent errors**: When a sub-agent's model rejects tool calls, propagate this error to the parent session
2. **Model capability checks**: Consider adding a model capability flag or pre-flight check for tool support
3. **Format validation**: Improve error messages when tool call JSON is malformed or when models generate tool-like text that isn't valid JSON

## Impact

This silent failure makes it very difficult to:
- Debug model compatibility issues
- Understand why sub-agents aren't working as expected  
- Choose appropriate models for tool-heavy workflows

## Environment

- Tested with ollama/llama3:8b (no tool support)
- Tested with llama3.1:8b via Ollama (generates malformed tool calls)
- OpenClaw spawning sub-agents with these models
