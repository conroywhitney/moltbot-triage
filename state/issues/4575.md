## Description

After clicking the new session button (next to Send), the new session replaces the old one. In the top-right sessions dropdown only a single entry shows:  for the new session. Previously, the dropdown listed multiple sessions (e.g., new session plus Telegram session and TUI session). Now all appear merged or replaced, so only the current session is visible.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Open webchat UI.\n2. Click the new session button next to Send.\n3. Open the sessions dropdown (top right).\n\n**Expected**\nMultiple sessions should be listed (main + Telegram + TUI), allowing switching between them, as before.\n\n**Actual**\nOnly one session appears:  (the current session). Older sessions are not visible.
