## Description

## Problem
The isolated Clawd browser profile cannot sign into Microsoft Teams (teams.microsoft.com) or likely any site using MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) silent token acquisition.

## What happens
1. Navigate to `https://teams.microsoft.com` in the isolated browser
2. Click **Sign in** → nothing happens
3. Console shows repeated `400` errors from `login.microsoftonline.com/.../oauth2/v2.0/token`
4. `BSSO Telemetry: {"result":"Error","error":"bssoNotSupported"}` — Browser SSO not available

Even after manually establishing a Microsoft session via `login.microsoftonline.com` (M365 portal loads fine), Teams still fails — it relies on silent token acquisition that never falls back to interactive login.

## Possible solutions
1. **Allow custom Chrome launch args** in config so users can relax restrictions
2. **Support a semi-isolated mode** that shares cookies with the main browser profile
3. **Remove `--disable-background-networking`** flag which may interfere with OAuth
4. **Document the limitation** and recommend `profile=chrome` for Microsoft/SSO-heavy sites

## Workaround
Use `profile="chrome"` with the Browser Relay extension.
