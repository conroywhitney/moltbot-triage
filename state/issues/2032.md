## Description

## Problem

When connecting to the Clawdbot dashboard from a wrapper app (e.g., Unite on macOS) without a valid gateway token, the error message says:

> disconnected (1008): unauthorized: gateway token missing (open a tokenized dashboard URL or paste token in Control UI settings)

However, **"Control UI settings"** doesn't exist. The actual location to paste the token is:

**Overview → Gateway Access**

## Impact

This is confusing for new users who don't know where to look. "Overview" makes sense once you understand what the dashboard does, but "Control UI settings" sends users hunting for a non-existent settings panel.

## Suggested Fix

Update the error message to say something like:

> ...or paste token in **Overview → Gateway Access**

Or add a "Settings" section that also allows token entry for discoverability.

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- macOS (using Unite app as a site-specific browser)
