## Description

## Summary

Community skills installed via `clawdhub` CLI currently live on the MoltHub registry without transparent backing to auditable source repositories. Users installing skills are trusting opaque hosted code.

## The Case for Transparency

When agents have significant capabilities — reading messages, storing credentials, executing commands — the skills they run should be auditable. Users should be able to:

1. **Inspect source** before installation (not just after downloading)
2. **Verify provenance** — know who authored a skill and see their commit history
3. **Track changes** — see diffs between versions before updating
4. **Fork and audit** — community security review becomes possible

A GitHub-backed model (or similar) would provide all of this inherently.

## Context

Recent security research highlighted the trust implications of AI agent infrastructure:

> *"The robot butlers are useful, they're not going away... The question isn't whether we'll deploy them — we will — but whether we can adapt our security posture fast enough to survive doing so."*

If we're asking users to trust community-contributed skills with agent capabilities, the least we can do is make that code transparently auditable.

## Proposal

- Require (or strongly encourage) skills to link to a public source repository
- Display source repo prominently in search results and install prompts
- Consider GitHub as the source of truth, with MoltHub as a discovery/search layer on top

## Related

This complements existing security hardening efforts and aligns with open-source community norms.

Sorry to pile on the security related items -- I can help get this setup if you're interested or need the extra hands.
