## Description

## Summary
Gateway dashboard /cron displays "(just now)" next to all scheduled wake times, even when they're in the future.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open the gateway dashboard
2. Navigate to /cron
3. Observe any cron job with a scheduled next wake time

## Expected behavior
The next wake time should display the actual scheduled time, without the "(just now)" suffix when it's in the future.

## Actual behavior
The next wake time shows "(just now)" appended even when the scheduled time is in the future.

Example output:
```
Next wake 2/2/2026, 2:00:00 AM (just now)
```
