## Description

**Feedback from a power user:**

**Pain point:** Slack integration lacks easy DM sending by email/name lookup. Had to fall back to email when trying to quickly message a colleague.

**Suggestions:**
- Look up Slack users by email or display name
- Send DMs without needing to know Slack user IDs  
- Smoother permission handling with clear error messages

This would be a big game changer for workplace automation.

Happy to chat with the dev team if helpful.
