## Description

## Summary

I deleted the gateway runner from a previous 1.29 install, and tried installing 1.30 and 2.1. Gateway file is missing.

## Steps to reproduce

0. Run the openclaw uninstall command, don't reboot
1. Delete the file that is running the gateway on boot
2. Try to install a newer version of openclaw via CMD
3. Complete the clawdbot onboard --install-daemon

## Expected behavior

The full installation capable of running the gateway, some repair functionality that restores missing core files.

## Actual behavior

The install says [*] existing openclaw installation detected, even when the uninstall command has run, and the folder .openclaw is empty. The installation isn't able to repair a damaged or missing gateway runner via doctor.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 1.30 to 2.1
- OS: Winows 10
- Install method (cmd from main page):

## Logs or screenshots

Gateway page error: 
Unable to connect
Browser can’t establish a connection to the server at 127.0.0.1:18789.

Had to ask another AI what to do and it recommended the command:
openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose and this seems to start it. There's still no file running this at startup like before in 1.29
