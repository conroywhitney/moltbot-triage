## Description

## Summary
Cron jobs using `--session isolated --deliver --channel signal` fail with `Signal RPC -1: Failed to send message`. The agent runs successfully and generates output, but Signal delivery fails. Regular Signal messages (via `message` tool or conversation replies) work fine.

## Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **OS:** Ubuntu (minimal cloud image) on Proxmox
- **Node:** v22.22.0
- **Signal-cli:** 0.13.23 (daemon mode, HTTP on 127.0.0.1:8080)

## Steps to Reproduce

```bash
clawdbot cron add \
  --name "Test reminder" \
  --at "5m" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Test reminder message" \
  --deliver \
  --channel signal \
  --to "uuid:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  --delete-after-run
```

## Expected Behavior
Cron job runs, agent generates output, message is delivered to Signal recipient.

## Actual Behavior
Cron job runs repeatedly (because delivery fails, `deleteAfterRun` doesn't trigger), each run logs:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Error: Signal RPC -1: Failed to send message",
  "summary": "[Agent successfully generated output]",
  "durationMs": 5000
}
```

The job retries continuously, burning API tokens on each attempt.

## Investigation

### What works:
- Regular Signal inbound/outbound (conversation replies) ✅
- Direct sends via `message` tool ✅
- Main session cron with `--system-event` + manual send ✅

### What fails:
- Isolated cron → Signal delivery ❌

### Possibly related:
- Discord thread about `target: isolated` not routing to channels: https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1462387579331674312
- GitHub issue #1530 about cron delivery failing for external plugins (different error, but similar pattern)

## Hypothesis
The isolated cron session may use a different code path for Signal delivery that doesn't properly connect to the signal-cli daemon, or there's a context/authentication issue when cron's delivery code calls Signal RPC vs when the main gateway does.

## Workaround
Using main session cron with `--system-event` and `--wake now`, then responding to the system event by sending via the `message` tool. This works but is token-inefficient (loads full main session context for each reminder).

## Additional Notes
- Signal channel shows "OK" in `clawdbot status`
- signal-cli daemon is running and responsive
- Same target format (`uuid:...`) works for direct sends but fails for cron delivery
