## Description

## Summary

When using the OpenClaw TUI via SSH (remote connection), the terminal colors are overridden by OpenClaw's hardcoded cyan color scheme. This prevents users from using their preferred iTerm2/terminal theme colors. This issue does not occur when using the TUI directly on the local machine via interactive shell.

## Current Behavior

- When SSHing into a machine running OpenClaw and launching the TUI, cyan text colors are applied
- These colors override the user's terminal theme settings
- The `seamColor` config option only affects some aspects, not the overall TUI text colors
- Setting `seamColor` to `null` causes a validation error: "Invalid input: expected string, received null"
- Removing `seamColor` entirely doesn't restore terminal default colors

## Expected Behavior

Users should be able to:
1. Disable OpenClaw's color overrides entirely when connected via SSH
2. Or have a `--no-color` flag for the TUI
3. Or have the TUI detect SSH sessions and respect terminal defaults

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Local terminal: iTerm2 on macOS
- Remote machine: macOS (SSH connection)
- Running via: `ssh remote-host` then `openclaw tui`

## Steps to Reproduce

1. SSH into a remote machine running OpenClaw
2. Run `openclaw tui`
3. Observe that cyan text colors override the local terminal's theme

Note: Running `openclaw tui` directly on the local machine (not via SSH) respects the terminal theme correctly.

## Additional Context

This is particularly relevant for users who:
- Run OpenClaw as a service on a headless server
- SSH into the server to interact with the TUI
- Have carefully configured terminal themes for accessibility or preference reasons
