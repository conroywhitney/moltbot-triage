## Description

Context
- The ACP registry entry for Moltbot currently needs to pin to `clawdbot@2026.1.24` because the registry requires strict numeric `x.y.z` versions and matching npm package versions.
- The `moltbot` CLI on npm is currently only available as prerelease tags (e.g. `2026.1.27-beta.1`).

Request
- Publish a stable npm version of `moltbot` that:
  - uses a strict numeric `x.y.z` version (no prerelease suffix)
  - exposes a `moltbot` CLI `bin`
  - supports `moltbot acp`

Why
- This enables the official ACP registry entry to reference `moltbot@<stable>` directly.

- ACP registry PR: agentclientprotocol/registry#17
