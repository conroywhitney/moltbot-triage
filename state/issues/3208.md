## Description

## Description
After multiple context compactions (3+) with a large context (~193k tokens), the model started outputting random Hebrew characters (gibberish) instead of coherent responses.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 / Opus 4.5
- Channel: WhatsApp
- OS: Linux

## Steps to reproduce
1. Long conversation with many tool calls
2. Context grows to ~190k+ tokens
3. Multiple compactions occur (3+)
4. At some point, responses become gibberish

## What happened
- Model started outputting random Hebrew text
- Could not recover within the session
- Required full restart

## Workaround applied
- Reduced contextTokens to 100k to trigger earlier/gentler compaction

## Questions
1. Is this a known issue with compaction?
2. Is there a way to detect this state before it becomes unrecoverable?
3. Are there recommended compaction settings to prevent this?

## Logs
Unfortunately no logs were captured from the incident. Will enable logging for future occurrences.
