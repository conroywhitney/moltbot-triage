## Description

## Severity: Critical

## Description
The HTTP server can run without TLS encryption, potentially exposing credentials and sensitive data in transit.

## Location
- `src/gateway/server-http.ts` (lines 226-232)

```typescript
const httpServer: HttpServer = opts.tlsOptions
  ? createHttpsServer(opts.tlsOptions, ...)
  : createHttpServer(...);
```

## Risk
Credentials, tokens, and sensitive data may be transmitted unencrypted over the network.

## Recommendation
- Enforce HTTPS in production environments
- Add a warning or error when HTTP is used in non-development mode
- Document security implications of running without TLS
