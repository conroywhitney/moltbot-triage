## Description

## Summary
When running the install.sh script, the installation fails at the npm step. However, npm is already installed on my machine. I saw another issue, #3782, that mentioned installing openssl to fix an issue with npm; that didn't work for me.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run `curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash`

## Expected behavior
Moltbot is installed.

## Actual behavior
The message "npm install failed; cleaning up and retrying..." is displayed and the installer exits.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: MacOS 15.7.4
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): curl

did you try use Node v22? ... I also had troubles with Node v24 installed over nvm.
Also: How did you install Node?
