## Description

## 🚨 Urgency

This is causing active productivity loss. Sessions drop during model instability, requiring manual intervention and reconfiguration. This is a critical gap compared to competing tools.

## Problem

When a model becomes unavailable (rate limits, outages, API errors), sessions hard-fail or disconnect. Users must manually reconfigure to switch models, which kills productivity.

**Currently available:**
- Per-session override via `/model` or `session_status`
- Sub-agent spawning with explicit `model` param
- Config-level default model

**What's missing:**

## Proposed Features

### 1. Auto-Fallback Chains
Allow configuring a fallback sequence in gateway config:
```yaml
models:
  primary: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
  fallback:
    - anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    - amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet
```

If primary fails (rate limit, 5xx, timeout), automatically try the next model in chain without dropping the session.

### 2. Graceful Degradation
Keep sessions alive during model failures. Queue messages or transparently retry with fallback instead of disconnecting.

### 3. Smart Model Routing (Nice-to-Have)
Auto-detect task complexity and route to appropriate model tier:
- Simple queries → Haiku (cost savings)
- Code/analysis → Sonnet
- Complex reasoning → Opus

### 4. Easy Model Switching UX
Other tools (Cursor, Continue, etc.) offer simple dropdown switches. Consider:
- Inline model picker in webchat
- Sticky model preference per channel/user

## Impact
- **Reduced session drops** during model instability
- **Better cost optimization** through intelligent routing
- **Smoother UX** comparable to competing tools
- **Higher reliability** for production/business use cases

## Use Case
Power users running multiple agents, sub-agents, and automated workflows need resilient model handling. Current behavior breaks workflows at the worst times.

If its urgent, PR the fix yourself

### @Brixyy (2026-01-29)

👍 +1 especially for the Smart Model Routing section. Auto-detecting task complexity would be a game changer for balancing cost vs capability.
