## Description

## Problem
Currently, all cron jobs inherit the session's model configuration. This creates two issues:

**Cost inefficiency**: 
Simple tasks (weather checks, token expiry monitoring) consume the same expensive model as complex analysis tasks

**Security concerns**: 
Giving powerful models access to routine automated tasks creates unnecessary risk when simpler models would suffice

## Use Case

Different cron jobs have vastly different complexity requirements:
**Simple checks** (Haiku-appropriate): Weather alerts, token expiry, heartbeat maintenance
**Complex analysis** (Sonnet-appropriate): Security bulletins with CVE verification, breach analysis, remediation reports
## Proposed Solution

Add optional `model` field to cron job payload:

```json{  
"name": "weather-morning",  
"schedule": {"kind": "cron", "expr": "0 7 * * *"},
  "payload": { 
   "kind": "agentTurn",
    "model": "haiku",  // NEW: override session model
    "message": "Check weather..."
  }
}
```


If model is omitted, fallback to session default (current behavior).

Benefits

• Cost optimization: Right-size models to task complexity
• Security: Limit powerful model access to tasks that truly need it
• Flexibility: Mix model tiers within same agent deployment

Example Savings
Running 2 weather checks/day on Haiku vs Sonnet could save ~80% on those automated tasks while maintaining quality for simple structured checks.
