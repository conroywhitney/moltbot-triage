## Description

## Summary

I'd love to see **Apple HealthKit integration** in the iOS node app. This would allow the assistant to access health data (with user permission) and provide personalized insights.

## Use Cases

- **Daily health summaries**: "How did I sleep last night?" / "How many steps today?"
- **Fitness tracking**: "What's my weekly workout trend?"
- **Health reminders**: Context-aware suggestions based on activity levels
- **Personal AI companion**: The assistant becomes more helpful when it knows your health context

## Requested Data Points (with permission)

- Steps & Distance
- Sleep analysis
- Heart rate (resting, workout)
- Workouts (type, duration, calories)
- Active/Rest energy
- Stand hours
- Mindfulness minutes

## Implementation Ideas

1. New `health.get` command via `node.invoke`
2. Permission request flow on first access
3. Data returned as JSON for the assistant to process
4. Optional: Background sync for proactive insights

## Why This Matters

With Talk Mode and Voice Wake already working beautifully, adding HealthKit would make the iOS node a true **personal AI companion** - not just a voice interface, but an assistant that understands your physical wellbeing.

## Environment

- iOS node (internal preview)
- Would require HealthKit entitlement and privacy permissions

Happy to provide more details or help test! 🦞
