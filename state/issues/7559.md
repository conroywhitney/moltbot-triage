## Description

## GitHub Username
cnshenyi

## Email (for TestFlight)
Please DM on Discord or Twitter (@cnshenyi)

## Use Case
- Want to use iOS device as a node for camera/location capabilities
- Planning to integrate with my OpenClaw setup for real-time photo capture and location tracking
- Also interested in Android node for SMS capabilities

## Additional Context
- Already running OpenClaw Gateway on macOS
- Familiar with the node pairing process
- Happy to provide feedback and bug reports during beta

## Alternative
If TestFlight is not available, I'm also willing to build from source. Are there any specific instructions for building the iOS/Android apps from the `apps/ios` and `apps/android` directories?

Thanks! 🦞
