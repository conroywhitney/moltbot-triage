## Description

## Description

When the LLM calls `session_status` with no arguments (as documented - all parameters are optional), validation fails with:

```
Validation failed for tool "session_status":
  - root: must be object

Received arguments:
undefined
```

## Expected Behavior

The `session_status` tool should accept calls with no arguments, as all parameters are documented as optional.

## Actual Behavior

The tool returns a validation error. After this error, the session becomes unresponsive - no further messages from the user receive replies. The session had to be manually cleared via the web interface to recover.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. In a conversation, have the LLM call `session_status` without any arguments
2. Tool returns validation error
3. Session becomes stuck - subsequent user messages are not processed

## Session Log Evidence

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-27T20:20:49.797Z",
  "message": {
    "role": "toolResult",
    "toolName": "session_status",
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Validation failed for tool \"session_status\":\n  - root: must be object\n\nReceived arguments:\nundefined"
    }],
    "isError": true
  }
}
```

## Environment

- Provider: google-antigravity
- Model: claude-opus-4-5-thinking
- Session became completely unresponsive after this error

## Impact

- **Severity**: High - causes complete session failure
- **Workaround**: Clear session via web interface and start fresh (loses all context)
