## Description

•  Version: 2026.1.24-3
•  OS: macOS
•  Node version: v24.7.0
•  Install method: npm install -g clawdbot@latest
•  Error: npm error notarget No matching version found for libsignal@whiskeysockets-libsignal-node-master.tar.gz-art-external
•  The error log you showed earlier
•  Note that the official installer script also fails with the same error

## Comments

### @JRChow (2026-01-28)

Same. Gemini says:

> The Diagnosis: The maintainers of the clawdbot package hardcoded a dependency on a specific Release Candidate of a WhatsApp library (@whiskeysockets/baileys@7.0.0-rc.9). That specific RC version is broken; its internal manifest points to a private/temporary build artifact (...tar.gz-art-external) instead of a public file.
