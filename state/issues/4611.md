## Description

## Context
Telegram channels support per-group `systemPrompt` configuration:
yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    groups:
      <group_id>:
        systemPrompt: "Context for this specific group..."


## Request
Add the same capability for WhatsApp groups:
yaml
channels:
  whatsapp:
    groups:
      <group_jid>:
        systemPrompt: "Context for this specific group..."


## Use Case
- Different groups require different AI personas/context
- NOC groups need technical focus
- Sales groups need commercial context
- Each group has unique rules and key people

## Current Workaround
Reading context files from workspace, but native support would be cleaner.
