## Description

## Summary

Currently, the Control UI is fully visible to unauthenticated visitors. While they cannot interact with the gateway without a valid token (which is secure), the entire interface is exposed:

- Menu structure (Chat, Channels, Skills, Config, etc.)
- Branding (Moltbot logo, "Gateway Dashboard" text)
- Page layouts and functionality hints

## Request

Add a configuration option to display **only a login/token prompt** until authentication is successful, hiding all UI elements behind it.

Example config option:
```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "controlUi": {
      "requireAuthBeforeRender": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Current behavior

1. User visits `https://my-moltbot.example.com`
2. Full UI loads with "Health: Offline" and "Disconnected from gateway"
3. Error banner shows: "gateway token missing"
4. All menu items and page structure are visible

## Expected behavior (with this feature)

1. User visits `https://my-moltbot.example.com`
2. Only a minimal login form is displayed (token input field)
3. After entering valid token, full UI renders

## Benefits

- **Security through obscurity**: Don't reveal what software is running
- **No information leakage**: Menu structure, features, and branding stay hidden
- **Cleaner UX**: First-time visitors see a clear login prompt instead of a "broken" interface
- **Professional appearance**: Looks like a proper secured application

## Context

Related to #2245 which addressed authentication bypass issues. This request is about the UX/information disclosure aspect that wasn't covered.
