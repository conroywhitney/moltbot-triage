## Description

## Bug Description

The browser screenshot action returns images with incorrect dimensions. Instead of capturing at the viewport size (e.g., 1280x800), the screenshots are being resized/compressed to very narrow and tall dimensions like 84x2000 or 223x2000.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a page with the browser tool
2. Resize viewport to standard dimensions (1280x800)
3. Take screenshot with fullPage=false
4. Check resulting file dimensions

## Expected Behavior

Screenshot should be 1280x800 (matching viewport).

## Actual Behavior

Screenshot is 223x2000 or 84x2000 - extremely narrow and tall.

## Workaround

Taking screenshot directly via CDP (Page.captureScreenshot) works correctly and returns the proper 1280x800 image.

## Environment

- OpenClaw: latest
- Browser: Chrome headless
- Profile: clawd (headless: true, noSandbox: true)
- OS: Linux Ubuntu

## Impact

Screenshots sent to Telegram are rejected with PHOTO_INVALID_DIMENSIONS error due to the abnormal aspect ratio.
