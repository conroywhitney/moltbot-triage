## Description

## Problem
When a user sends an image via Telegram and the media fetch fails, the error is only logged server-side. The user receives no response at all.

## Log
```
[telegram] handler failed: MediaFetchError: Failed to fetch media from https://api.telegram.org/file/bot.../photos/file_X.jpg: TypeError: fetch failed
```

## Expected behavior
- Send user an ack like "Failed to process image" on error
- Or pass the error to Claude so it can respond appropriately

## Notes
- Same URL downloads fine via curl (123KB file)
- Likely a Node.js fetch issue (timeout or network config)
