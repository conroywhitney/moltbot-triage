## Description

## Description

The OpenClaw logo and text in the dashboard sidebar header appear to overlap/clip when the sidebar is at its default width.

## Screenshot

The logo (lobster icon) and the text "OPENCLAW / GATEWAY DASHBOARD" are visually overlapping, with part of the logo being cut off.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Linux (WSL2) 
- Browser: Chrome (Windows)
- Dashboard URL: http://127.0.0.1:18789/

## Expected Behavior

The logo should be fully visible alongside the text without clipping.

## Possible Cause

CSS overflow or flex layout issue in the sidebar header component when the container width is constrained.

## Relevant CSS

```css
logo{width:28px;height:28px;flex-shrink:0}
logo img{width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:contain}
```

The `flex-shrink:0` should prevent shrinking, but something in the parent container may be causing the clip.
