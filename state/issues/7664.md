## Description

## Summary

Running `pnpm audit` on OpenClaw v2026.1.30 reveals 4 high-severity vulnerabilities in nested dependencies.

## Vulnerabilities

| CVE/Advisory | Package | Vulnerable | Fixed | Dependency Chain |
|--------------|---------|------------|-------|------------------|
| [GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97) | tar | <=7.5.2 | >=7.5.3 | openclaw → node-llama-cpp → cmake-js → tar |
| [GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w) | tar | <=7.5.3 | >=7.5.4 | openclaw → node-llama-cpp → cmake-js → tar |
| [GHSA-34x7-hfp2-rc4v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-34x7-hfp2-rc4v) | tar | <7.5.7 | >=7.5.7 | openclaw → node-llama-cpp → cmake-js → tar |
| [GHSA-37qj-frw5-hhjh](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-37qj-frw5-hhjh) | fast-xml-parser | >=4.3.6 <=5.3.3 | >=5.3.4 | openclaw → @aws-sdk/client-bedrock → ... → fast-xml-parser |

## Risk Assessment

- **tar vulnerabilities**: Path traversal and symlink poisoning during archive extraction. Low risk unless extracting untrusted archives.
- **fast-xml-parser**: DoS via malformed XML numeric entities. Only affects Bedrock API users.

## Suggested Fix

Update transitive dependencies or add pnpm overrides to force patched versions.

## Environment

- OpenClaw: 2026.1.30
- OS: Windows 11
- Node: v22.18.0
- Package manager: pnpm
