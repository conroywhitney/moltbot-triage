## Description

Bug report written by my clawdbot, me just copy-paste:

**Describe the bug**
Clicking “New session” (or using /new / /reset) effectively nukes the current conversation context. This is surprising/dangerous UX: “New” normally implies starting another session in parallel, not destroying the current one.

**Expected behavior**
“New session” should create a separate thread/session while keeping the previous session accessible (like opening a new tab / new chat thread).
If there is a destructive action (“Reset/clear context”), it should be clearly labeled and gated behind a confirmation/warning.
Actual behavior

The current session context is cleared/lost when starting a new session, with no obvious way to recover the previous context.

**Steps to reproduce**
Open webchat and have an ongoing conversation.
Click “New session” (or run /new or /reset).
Observe previous context is gone from the active chat; conversation cannot continue without manually restating context.
Impact
High: easy to lose important context/work; discourages use.

**Environment**

Clawdbot webchat (please fill: browser + OS + clawdbot version if known)

**Suggested fix**

Split “New chat/thread” vs “Reset context”.
Add confirmation + automatic “handoff snapshot” before reset.
Provide session/thread navigation to return to previous sessions.
