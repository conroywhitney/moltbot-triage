## Description

Hi everyone,

I am currently trying to optimize my OpenClaw setup to run fully locally using Ollama. My goal is to achieve stable, long-running autonomous sessions without relying on external APIs, primarily to keep the workflow cost-effective and private.

The Challenge: I am struggling to find a local model that maintains its "intelligence" over long interactions. Most models I’ve tested (Llama 3, Mistral) eventually lose track of their system instructions, fail to follow the agentic loop, or even "forget" their identity/role defined in the prompt.

Observations: The only model that has shown decent reasoning and instruction-following so far is glm-4:9b. However, even with GLM, the local reliability isn't quite there for fully autonomous, multi-step tasks.

My Hardware:

GPU: NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti (16GB VRAM)

Environment: Local Ollama instance

Request for Best Practices: I would appreciate any insights from the community on how to stabilize local execution for autonomous tasks:

Recommended Models: Are there specific models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder or specialized fine-tunes) that you found to be more resilient in OpenClaw's agentic loops compared to the standard Llama/Mistral weights?

Context Configuration: What is the ideal num_ctx for local agents to prevent the system prompt from being "pushed out" during long tasks? Is 32k viable on 16GB VRAM while maintaining speed?

Quantization vs. Intelligence: For those on 16GB cards, do you prioritize larger models with higher compression (e.g., 14B at Q4) or smaller models with higher precision (e.g., 7B/9B at Q8)?

OpenClaw Prompt Adherence: Are there specific configuration tweaks within OpenClaw to help local models stay "locked in" on their persona and task objectives?

I am looking to create a reliable "set it and forget it" local environment. Any advice on the optimal balance between model size and context length for a 16GB card would be immensely helpful.

Thanks!

Seconding this, we need things to be small-scale + portable
