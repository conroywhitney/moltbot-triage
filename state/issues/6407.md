## Description

## Problem

WebChat responses sometimes cut off mid-stream and stop rendering. The message appears truncated:

```
The 45MB monster: That's our origin story! Jan 27 — "Wake up, my friend!" → "let's call you Ziggy" 🥹 It's huge because it's our full first conversation with all the bootstrap back-and-forth. Let me clean up an
```

The actual response continues server-side, but the UI stops updating. **Refreshing the browser (F5) shows the complete response.**

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start a webchat session
2. Send a message that triggers a longer response (especially one with tool calls)
3. Watch the response stream — sometimes it stops mid-word/sentence
4. Refresh browser to see the complete message

## Expected Behavior

Response should stream completely to the UI without requiring a refresh.

## Environment

- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
- Browser: (likely Chrome on macOS)
- Gateway: local mode, loopback

## Notes

- Possibly related to WebSocket reconnection or stream event handling
- May be exacerbated by tool calls mid-response
- Different from #6327 (history persistence) — this is about active stream rendering
