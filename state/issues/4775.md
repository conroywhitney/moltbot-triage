## Description

## Summary
Telegram reactions currently queue as system events and are only processed when the next user message arrives. This creates a UX gap where reaction-based workflows (e.g., 👍 to confirm, 👎 to cancel) require a follow-up message to trigger action or provoke a response. At that point, I might as well just have said "yes" or "no". 

So today: 
1. User reacts to bot message
2. Reaction queued as system event
3. User must send another message
4. Agent sees reaction + message together

Ideal:
1. User reacts to bot message
2. Agent wakes immediately and processes the reaction

## Proposed solution
Add a config option to trigger an immediate agent turn when a reaction is received:
```
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      reactionNotifications: "all",
      wakeOnReaction: true  // New option: wake agent on reaction
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternatives considered
Alternatively, this could be a value in reactionNotifications (seems worse, but your call):

• "all" — notify on next message (current)
• "all-wake" — notify and wake immediately

## Additional context
My use case: I use emoji reactions as lightweight commands (👍 confirm, 📌 save to memory, 🗑️ delete). Having to send a follow-up message defeats the purpose of quick reaction-based interactions.

### Environment

• OpenClaw 2026.1.29
• Telegram channel (polling mode)
