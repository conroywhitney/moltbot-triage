## Description

Enable support for native windows

## Proposed solution
Configure clawdbot to use Microsoft foundry which can use the models and apis natively

## Comprehensive Windows experience report

Running Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3 on Windows 10 (10.0.19045), Node v24.13.0. Here's a summary of Windows-specific issues we've encountered:

### 1. ESM loader file:// path handling (#2829)
`import.meta.url.replace("file://", "")` produces `/C:/Users/...` on Windows. Affects session-memory hook and `normalizeMediaSource()` in `dist/media/parse.js`. Fix: use `new URL(import.meta.url).pathname` with drive-letter normalization.

### 2. Duplicate dist/dist/ build output (#2877)
Build produces nested `dist/dist/hooks/` alongside `dist/hooks/`. Patches applied to the wrong copy have no effect.

### 3. Scheduled Task path display
`clawdbot doctor` shows entrypoint path without backslashes: `C:UsersukrAppData...` — cosmetic but misleading.

### 4. WSL2/Docker DNS conflict
`wslservice.exe` locks Tailscale DNS resolution file, causing intermittent network instability for the gateway. Workaround: set WslService to Manual start.

### 5. Auth failover cascade (#2811)
Gateway crashes + restarts hit API rate limits from queued messages. 484s queue backup observed.

### What works well
- Gateway runs stable once started
- Scheduled Task auto-start via `gateway.cmd` works
- Watchdog script monitors and recovers crashes
- Chrome webchat works (after cache clear on stale sessions)

Happy to provide logs or further details.
