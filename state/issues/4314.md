## Description

## Feature Request

### Description

Add a configurable idle timeout for Talk mode so that after a period of silence/inactivity, the app automatically stops listening and returns to wake word (swabble) detection mode.

### Use Case

When using Talk mode with a wake word like "claudia", after the conversation ends, the microphone stays active indefinitely in Talk mode. The user must manually stop Talk mode to return to wake word detection. This is inconvenient for hands-free usage.

### Proposed Behavior

- After a configurable period of silence (e.g., 30 seconds), Talk mode automatically deactivates
- The app returns to wake word (swabble) listening mode
- The timeout should be configurable via preferences (e.g., `clawdbot.talkIdleTimeoutSeconds`)
- A value of `0` could mean "never auto-stop" (current behavior)

### Suggested Configuration

```json
// In macOS app preferences
"clawdbot.talkIdleTimeoutSeconds": 30
```

Or in `clawdbot.json`:
```json
{
  "talk": {
    "idleTimeoutSeconds": 30
  }
}
```

### Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- macOS (Clawdbot.app)
- Talk mode + Swabble (wake word) enabled
