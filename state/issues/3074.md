## Description

## Feature Request

Add support for checking user online/offline presence via the Slack `users.getPresence` API.

### Context
- The `users:read` scope is sufficient for this API call
- Current Slack actions support: reactions, messages, pins, member-info, emoji-list
- Missing: presence/online status check

### Slack API Reference
https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/users.getPresence/

### Suggested Implementation
Add a new action like `presence` or `get-presence` to the Slack plugin that calls `users.getPresence` and returns the user's presence status (active/away).

### Use Case
Check if team members are online before pinging them, or monitor workspace activity.
