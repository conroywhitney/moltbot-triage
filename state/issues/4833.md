## Description

# `openclaw node run` fails silently with "1008: pairing required" when connecting to a remote gateway

## Summary
When connecting a node to a remote gateway (e.g., via Tailscale) using `openclaw node run`, the connection is immediately rejected with WebSocket code `1008: pairing required` (or "device identity required") without ever creating a pending pairing request on the Gateway.

This happens because the CLI does not automatically generate or persist a Device Identity (ID + keys) by default when running in node mode, causing the Gateway's strict handshake validation to fail before the pairing logic is triggered.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Setup a Gateway on Host A (Remote).
2. On Host B (Node), configure the remote URL: `openclaw config set gateway.remote.url wss://...`
3. Run `openclaw node run` (without flags).

## Expected behavior
The CLI should generate a transient or persistent Device Identity automatically, allowing the Gateway to accept the handshake and queue a "Pending Pairing Request" for the administrator to approve.

## Actual behavior
The process exits immediately:
`node host gateway closed (1008): pairing required`
No pending request appears on the Gateway.

**Workaround:**
The user must manually provide identity flags to bypass this:
`openclaw node run --node-id my-node --display-name "My Node" ...`

## Environment
- **OpenClaw version:** 2026.1.29 (a5b4d22)
- **Mode:** Remote (Tailscale/WSS)

That workaround work for me.
```
    "controlUi": {
      "allowInsecureAuth": true
    }
```
