## Description

## Problem

A profile named `anthropic:default` has implicit special priority and is always selected, regardless of the `auth.order` configuration.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure two auth profiles: `anthropic:default` and `anthropic:secondary`
2. Set `auth.order.anthropic: ["secondary", "default"]`
3. Restart gateway
4. Observe that `anthropic:default` is still used despite being second in order

## Expected Behavior

The `auth.order` config should be respected. The first available profile in the order should be selected.

## Workaround

Rename `anthropic:default` to something else (e.g., `anthropic:primary`). The order is then respected correctly.

## Analysis

The profile name "default" appears to have hardcoded special meaning in the auth selection logic, bypassing the configured order.

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Multiple Anthropic OAuth profiles
- Both profiles valid and working
