## Description

## Description

When using the OpenClaw managed browser (`profile=openclaw`), downloads triggered from blob URLs (e.g., `blob:null/...`) fail to save to disk.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Start OpenClaw with managed browser enabled
2. Navigate to a site that generates downloadable content via blob URLs (e.g., Gemini image generation)
3. Click the download button
4. Check `~/Downloads` — file is not there

## Expected behavior

The file should be saved to the configured downloads directory.

## Actual behavior

- Chrome shows the download in `chrome://downloads/` with the blob URL
- "Show in folder" button does nothing
- File never appears in the filesystem

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: latest (npm)
- OS: Ubuntu Linux (x64)
- Browser: Google Chrome (via `executablePath`)
- Config: `headless: true`, `noSandbox: true`

## Workaround

Use a regular Chrome instance to download files manually, then provide them to the agent.

## Notes

This might be related to sandbox/headless restrictions on blob URL handling. Regular HTTP downloads may work fine — the issue is specific to blob-based downloads.
