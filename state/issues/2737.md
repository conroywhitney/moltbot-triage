## Description

## Problem
The webchat UI has two main issues:

1. **Page freezes/gets stuck** - requires manual refresh to see new content
2. **Progress display is cluttered** - when an agent does multi-step work with polling (like monitoring a long-running process), the output becomes very noisy and hard to follow

## Expected Behavior
1. Page should auto-update without needing refresh
2. Repeated/similar outputs (like polling status) could be collapsed or shown more compactly

## Environment
- Windows 11
- Chrome browser
- Clawdbot latest (npm)

## Comments

### @matt-bedda (2026-01-28)

+1 — experiencing the same "refresh required" issue with more specific repro:

**Environment:**
- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Ubuntu 24.04, Chrome (latest)
- Gateway on loopback

**Specific behavior:**
1. Agent starts responding — typing indicator visible ✅
2. Initial text streams into UI normally ✅
3. Agent makes tool calls — **UI stops updating** ❌
4. No tool call info appears (stuck on last text)
5. Manual page refresh reveals:
   - All the tool calls completed successfully
   - Tool results rendered
   - Subsequent assistant messages present

**Key observation:** The WebSocket connection seems alive (typing indicator worked), but tool call events aren't being pushed/rendered in the UI. It's not a full disconnect — it's specifically tool call updates that go missing.

This happens consistently during multi-tool workflows. Single quick responses stream fine.

Happy to provide browser console logs or gateway debug output if helpful.
