## Description

## Problem

When using a single OAuth profile (e.g., `google-antigravity:user@gmail.com`) with model fallbacks configured:

```json5
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash",
        "fallbacks": [
          "google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-high",
          "google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When the primary model (gemini-3-flash) returns a 429 rate limit error:

1. OpenClaw puts the profile into cooldown (exponential backoff: 1min → 5min → 25min → 1hr)
2. It tries to rotate to the "next profile" for the same provider
3. **But there is no other profile available**
4. **Result**: The agent gets stuck waiting for cooldown to expire, instead of immediately falling back to the next model in `fallbacks`

This requires manual intervention (`/model ...`) to switch models.

## Expected Behavior

When a provider has only **one auth profile** and it enters cooldown due to rate limiting:
- OpenClaw should **immediately trigger model fallback** to the next model in `fallbacks`
- Instead of waiting for the cooldown to expire

## Suggested Solutions

### Option A: Auto-fallback for single-profile providers
Detect when a provider has only one profile. When that profile enters cooldown, immediately advance to the next fallback model.

### Option B: Configuration option
Add a config option like:
```json5
{
  "auth": {
    "cooldowns": {
      "fallbackOnSingleProfile": true  // default: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Option C: Per-model rate limit isolation
If different models under the same provider have independent rate limits (e.g., Gemini Flash vs Pro), treat them as separate "virtual profiles" for cooldown purposes.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- Provider: google-antigravity (Antigravity Auto subscription)
- Single OAuth profile configured

## Additional Context

The current behavior assumes multiple profiles exist for rotation. For users with a single OAuth account, the fallback mechanism doesn't activate as expected, leading to a degraded experience where manual model switching is required during rate limit events.
