## Description

**Feature:** Human-in-the-loop approval configuration for high-risk tool invocations

**Use case:** Prevent autonomous agents from executing destructive operations (file deletion, credential usage, sudo commands) without explicit user confirmation.

**Proposed config:**
```javascript
{
  "approval": {
    "required": [
      "exec:rm",
      "exec:sudo",
      "exec:chmod",
      "credential:use",
      "file:delete"
    ],
    "timeout": 300,  // seconds to wait for approval
    "channel": "discord",  // where to send approval requests
    "denyByDefault": true  // if timeout expires, deny
  }
}
```

**How it would work:**
1. Agent attempts to run `rm -rf /tmp/data`
2. OpenClaw pauses execution, sends approval request to user (Discord DM, CLI prompt, web UI)
3. User approves/denies within timeout window
4. If approved: execute and log. If denied/timeout: block and log.

**Why this matters:**
- OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 #A04 (Missing Human-in-the-Loop Controls)
- Critical safety layer for production autonomous agents
- Prevents accidental data loss and credential leakage

**Example approval request:**
```
⚠️ Approval Required

Tool: exec
Command: rm -rf /tmp/important-files
Requested by: agent:main
Context: Cleanup task during memory optimization

[Approve] [Deny] [View Context]

Timeout: 5:00
```

**Alternative approach:**
If full approval gates are too complex initially, even a simple `tools.exec.requireConfirm: ["rm", "sudo"]` would be valuable.

**Related:** Part of OWASP security hardening recommendations. Would complement the existing `tools.exec.allowlist` feature.
