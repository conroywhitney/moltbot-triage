## Description

## Summary

If agents ever run amok for whatever reason it might be useful to be able to post a file on the internet to pause the cron job preemptive processing while the problem is addressed. This should be designed in at an early stage. A refinement might be to be able to post a version in the file agents should upgrade to before they can proceed.

## Expected behavior

Responsibly roll out AI.

## Actual behavior

Lack of control in the event of unintended consequences.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: All
- OS: All
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): All
