## Description

Problem

Current event monitoring requires polling via cron jobs, burning tokens and missing real-time updates.

Example use case: Monitoring live cricket scores, breaking news, or stock price movements requires fetching every N minutes, wasting API calls when nothing changes.

Proposed Solution

A lightweight event stream monitor service that:

• Watches RSS feeds, websockets, or API streams continuously
• Matches against keyword patterns or event triggers (regex, conditionals)
• Only wakes Clawdbot/sends messages when conditions match
• Zero token consumption while idle
Benefits

• Instant notifications instead of 10min polling delays
• Massive token savings - no repeated fetches of unchanged content
• Scalable - one service can monitor multiple streams for multiple agents
Example Rules

- name: cricket-play-resumes
  source: https://bbc.com/sport/cricket/live/xyz
  pattern: "play (resumes|starts)|toss completed"
  action: notify session:main

- name: stock-spike
  source: ws://quotes.example.com/GOOGL
  condition: price_change > 5%
  action: wake cron:market-alert

Implementation Notes

Could integrate with existing cron wake mechanism or message directly to sessions. Service runs separately, minimal coupling to core Clawdbot.
