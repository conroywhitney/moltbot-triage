## Description

## Problem

To delete a session, you have to navigate to the Sessions tab, find the session, and click Delete. This is cumbersome when you're already in the Chat tab looking at the session you want to delete.

## Expected

A Delete button directly in the Chat tab compose area, so you can delete the current session without leaving the page.

## Solution

- 🗑 icon button next to "New session" / "Send" in the compose bar
- Native `confirm()` dialog on click (no custom modal)
- Disabled for main session (cannot delete main)
- After deletion: automatically switches to main session and refreshes chat history
- Mobile: input field stacked above buttons, compact layout
