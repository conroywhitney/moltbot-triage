## Description

## Problem

To delete a session, you have to:
1. Go to Sessions tab
2. Find the session
3. Click Delete

This is cumbersome when you're already in the Chat tab looking at the session you want to delete.

## Expected

Delete button directly in Chat tab with confirmation.

## Proposed solution

Add Delete button next to 'New session' button with confirmation modal:
- Hidden for main session (cannot delete main)
- After deletion: switch to main session and refresh chat list
- Same behavior as Sessions tab (archive transcript)

## Environment

- Moltbot Web UI (Control Panel)
