## Comments

### @CWSpear (2026-02-02)

There seems to be a few issues with the mattermost plugin right now... but this first one seems to be because they haven't moved/re-published the plugin under the new namespace.

[`@clawdbot/mattermost`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clawdbot/mattermost) is still up, but there is no `@openclaw/mattermost` as of right now.
