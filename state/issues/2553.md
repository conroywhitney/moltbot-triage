## Description

I opened the PR to add sponsorship on the repo (https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/2189).

This was merged by @steipete, but the button is not visible right now.

This issue is a "task" so you don't forget to go to Settings and enable Sponsorships to make the button visible (it's a single checkbox).

## Comments

### @steipete (2026-01-27)

It's on GitHub's side to review.

### @alexstyl (2026-01-27)

What do you mean? There shouldn't be a need for external review for this AFAIK.

### @damoahdominic (2026-01-27)

Wanna support as well. Please let us know here when you get approval

### @alexstyl (2026-01-27)

@damoahdominic you can already support Peter via https://github.com/sponsors/steipete

This Issue discussed here is for making the Sponsor button visible on the repo itself.
