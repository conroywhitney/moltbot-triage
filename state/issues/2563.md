## Description

Clawdbot should have a traceable memory like git.

## Proposed solution
Connect Clawdbot with a git-like memory, 
rather than just Markdown.

Yep, git has more power than just version control. It's good at collaboration as well. So maybe Clawdbot can collaborate with more agents and with git.
