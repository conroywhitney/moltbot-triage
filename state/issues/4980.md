## Description

Problem
- Long-running interactive CLI flows can be terminated (SIGKILL) before the user completes the out-of-band step.

Example
- `gh auth login --web` prints the one-time code + URL, then waits for the user to approve.
- In some agent exec environments, the process gets SIGKILL before approval, so the auth never completes.

Workaround
- Run the command in a backgrounded session (or similar keep-alive), so the process can wait long enough for the user to complete approval.

Expected
- Tooling should avoid killing interactive flows prematurely, or provide a first-class pattern for “await external approval” flows.
