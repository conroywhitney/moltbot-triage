## Description

## Summary
When using iMessage, Clawdbot can ingest its *own outbound messages* as inbound user messages, particularly in self-chat threads (sender == recipient). This causes session loops, repeated responses, token overuse, and in some cases leakage of internal/system messages back into the chat.

Other channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, etc.) do not exhibit this behavior.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Enable the iMessage channel on macOS.
2. Start a direct iMessage conversation where the sender and recipient are the same identity (e.g. texting your own number / Apple ID).
3. Send a message that causes Clawdbot to reply.
4. Observe that Clawdbot’s outbound message is treated as a new inbound message.
5. The agent continues responding to itself, sometimes repeatedly.

## Expected behavior
Outbound messages sent by Clawdbot should **never** be re-ingested as inbound user messages.

Self-originated iMessage events (sender == recipient) should be dropped, matching the behavior of other channel adapters.

## Actual behavior
Outbound iMessage messages are sometimes received back as inbound events and passed to the agent as if they came from a human, causing:
- session loops
- repeated responses
- token burn
- occasional leakage of internal/system text into the chat

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: macOS Sequoia 15.2
- Install method: npm via `curl`

## Logs or screenshots
Attached screenshots show Clawdbot’s outbound iMessage replies being re-ingested as inbound messages, including rate-limit errors being echoed back and triggering further replies.

I can provide logs if helpful.
