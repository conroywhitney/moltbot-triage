## Description

## Problem

The current date/time injection in the system prompt only includes the timezone:

```javascript
return ["## Current Date & Time", `Time zone: ${params.userTimezone}`, ""];
```

This means the agent has to infer the date from message timestamps or run `date` to verify. This frequently leads to errors where the agent states the wrong day of the week — a common issue across LLMs.

## Proposed Solution

Include the full date with day of week in the injection:

```javascript
return [
  "## Current Date & Time",
  `${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric', timeZone: params.userTimezone })}`,
  `Time zone: ${params.userTimezone}`,
  ""
];
```

This would produce something like:
```
## Current Date & Time
Friday, January 30, 2026
Time zone: America/New_York
```

## Why This Matters

- Agents frequently get the day of week wrong when users ask
- Simple fix that benefits all users
- Removes need for agents to verify with `date` command
- Makes briefings and scheduling more reliable

Happy to submit a PR if helpful.
