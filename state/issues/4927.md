## Description

## Description

When `channels.slack.thread.inheritParent: true` is configured, the parent message of a Slack thread is **not** being injected into the thread session context. This means replies within a thread have no knowledge of the original message that started the thread.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure Slack with thread isolation:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "thread": {
        "historyScope": "thread",
        "inheritParent": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. In a Slack channel, post a message mentioning the bot: `@Bot who are you? Answer in one word.`
3. Bot replies in thread: `Stone`
4. Reply in thread: `Do another word.`
5. Bot has no context of the original question — it doesn't know what "another word" refers to

## Expected Behavior

With `inheritParent: true`, the thread session should include the parent message ("who are you? Answer in one word.") as context, so followup messages in the thread can reference it.

## Actual Behavior

Looking at the session transcript (`*-topic-*.jsonl`), the first user message is the reply ("Do another word.") — the parent message is not present. The bot has to search memory/files to try to find context.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- Channel: Slack (socket mode)
- Config: `thread.historyScope: "thread"`, `thread.inheritParent: true`

## Notes

The session key correctly creates isolated thread sessions (`agent:main:slack:channel:<id>:thread:<ts>`), but the parent message injection appears to not be implemented or is broken.
