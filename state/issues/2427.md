## Description

## Problem

The Control UI currently uses WebSocket for real-time chat streaming. Many corporate networks and firewalls block WebSocket connections due to the protocol upgrade handshake (`Upgrade: websocket`).

## Proposed Solution

Add an HTTP/SSE (Server-Sent Events) fallback mode:

- **SSE is firewall-friendly** — looks like regular HTTPS traffic (`text/event-stream`)
- **Works through corporate proxies** — no special protocol handling needed
- **Standard HTTP** — unidirectional server → client, which is sufficient for streaming responses
- **Precedent** — ChatGPT and Gemini both use SSE for their web UIs

## Implementation Notes

The Gateway already has HTTP endpoints. This would need:
1. An SSE streaming endpoint for chat responses
2. Client-side detection/fallback when WebSocket fails
3. Regular HTTP POST for sending messages (already possible)

## Use Case

Users accessing Clawdbot from restricted networks (corporate, hotel, airport WiFi) where WebSocket is blocked but HTTPS works fine.
