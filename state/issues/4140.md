## Description

**Summary:**  
Telegram forum topics: Regular messages are filtered out and never reach the agent, only slash commands work

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Create a Telegram supergroup with forum/topics enabled
2. Configure clawdbot with:
   ```json
   {
     "channels": {
       "telegram": {
         "groups": {
           "-100XXXXXXXXXX": {
             "requireMention": false,
             "topics": {
               "2": { "requireMention": false, "enabled": true }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Disable bot privacy mode in @BotFather (`/setprivacy` → Disable)
4. Add bot to the forum group
5. Send `/new` in a topic → Bot responds ✓
6. Send `/activation always` → Bot responds "⚙️ Group activation set to always" ✓
7. Send a regular message like "Hey, can you see this?" → **No response** ✗

**Expected behavior:**  
Bot should respond to all messages when `requireMention: false` and `/activation always` is set

**Actual behavior:**  
- Commands (`/new`, `/activation`) work perfectly
- Regular messages are filtered out before reaching the agent (never appear in session transcript)
- DMs work fine
- Regular Telegram groups (non-forum) work fine
- Issue persists in both polling and webhook modes

**Environment details:**
- Clawdbot version: `2026.1.24-3`
- Operating system: Linux 6.18.7-1-t2-noble
- Installation method: volta/npm

**Workaround:**  
Using separate regular Telegram groups instead of forum topics works perfectly.
