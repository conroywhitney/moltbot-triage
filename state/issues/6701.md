## Description

## Summary

Add an `agent:response` hook event that fires after the agent generates a response, before it's sent to the user.

## Use Case

Enable post-response processing for:
- Logging and auditing agent outputs
- Response analytics and monitoring
- Custom notification triggers
- Integration with external systems

Currently there's no way to hook into agent responses — only `agent:bootstrap` (before) exists.

## Proposed Event

```typescript
{
  type: 'agent',
  action: 'response',
  sessionKey: string,
  timestamp: Date,
  messages: string[],
  context: {
    responseText?: string,
    payloads: ReplyPayload[],
    model?: string,
    provider?: string,
    // ... session context
  }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

- **`agent:bootstrap`**: Only fires at session start, not per-response
- **Heartbeat checking**: Too slow, not real-time
- **Custom middleware**: Would require forking OpenClaw

## Related

The docs mention planned events `message:sent` and `message:received` — this would enable similar use cases for agent-specific responses.
