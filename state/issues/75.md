## Description

We have apps for macOS, iOS and Android (simpler nodes)

Linux and Windows are missing. Similar feature set to macOS ideally.

Started looking into Linux port. I'm testing using https://v2.tauri.app/ because Linux Qt/GTK3/GTK4/Wayland/X11 who knows. Linux purists will probably hate it but it's working.

My vision for this is a cute gtk-native Linux app. Esp for the statusbar features. This looks neat - I think we can do better tho!
(or offer more variants, native will take longer)

### @apoorvagnihotri (2026-01-24)

Looking forward to have linux support as well. I would love to contribute with my agents too. @steipete could you lead on how can we organize this? 

I am particularly interested in controlling my linux system via messages, run commands and in general have a similar level of support as macos. 

### @steipete (2026-01-24)

Awesome @apoorvagnihotri ! Just start and make a PR and we iteratively merge improvements!

### @uos-status (2026-01-25)

For windows/linux, taskbar widgets and/or systray integration would be awesome.
imagine replacing your windows searchbar with a clawdbot input field. -- but this could/should be a separate app. it would hook into the gateway websocket like any other app.
