## Description

## Summary

Fresh first-time install via curl installer completes successfully, but the CLI fails to start due to a missing native clipboard module for Apple Silicon.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Run `curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash`
2. Wait for install to complete
3. CLI fails immediately, `openclaw doctor` also fails

## Expected behavior

OpenClaw CLI should start after successful installation.

## Actual behavior

CLI fails with `Cannot find module '@mariozechner/clipboard-darwin-arm64'`. The installer says "OpenClaw installed successfully" but the CLI is unusable.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30
- OS: macOS (Darwin), Apple Silicon (aarch64)
- Node.js: v22.21.1
- Install method: curl installer
