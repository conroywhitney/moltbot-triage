## Description

Windows installer fails and CLI is not exposed due to missing bin entry in package.json

On Windows 10/11 (x64), Moltbot v0.1.0 cannot be installed or used as a CLI despite npm reporting a successful installation, and the official install.cmd script fails consistently with npm error code ENOENT. Using Node.js v24.13.0 and npm v11.6.2, running npm install -g moltbot@latest completes with “added 1 package”, but no executable (moltbot or moltbot.cmd) is created, and where moltbot returns no results; the global npm directory contains only node_modules/moltbot. Inspection of package.json reveals that the package is missing a "bin" field, so npm has no instruction to expose a CLI command even though the runtime entry point (dist/index.js) exists and is valid. As a result, the Moltbot CLI cannot be invoked globally on any platform, including Windows, regardless of environment correctness. Additionally, the official Windows installer (curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.cmd) fails with ENOENT even when Node.js and npm are properly installed, because it assumes the presence of a globally exposed CLI and spawns npm indirectly via node.exe, which breaks on Windows when no bin entry exists. Moltbot itself is confirmed to work correctly when executed directly (node node_modules/moltbot/dist/index.js prints “hello, moltbot”), proving that this is not a user configuration issue but a packaging and installer defect. The expected behavior is that npm install -g moltbot exposes a usable moltbot command and that the Windows installer completes successfully without requiring manual launchers or PATH workarounds. The recommended fix is to add a proper bin entry to package.json (for example "bin": { "moltbot": "dist/index.js" }), republish the package, and update install.cmd to call npm install -g moltbot directly with Windows-safe handling instead of invoking npm indirectly.``

This has been covered in many other issues (see #2856), try to install with `npm i moltbot@2026.1.27-beta.1` instead due to migration issues at the moment.
