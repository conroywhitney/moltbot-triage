## Description

CI lint currently fails due to two oxlint errors:

1) src/agents/tools/nodes-tool.ts — eslint(preserve-caught-error) when rethrowing JSON.parse errors without `cause`.
2) src/auto-reply/reply/commands-ptt.ts — typescript-eslint(no-unnecessary-type-assertion) on `res.payload as Record<string, unknown>`.

These are small, mechanical fixes that unblock `pnpm lint` in CI.
