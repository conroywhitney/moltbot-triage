## Description

Summary

Clawdbot is a knowledge management and proactive assistance runtime.
Vexa (Apache-2.0, open source) provides a real-time meeting data layer for Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams.

Integrating Vexa allows Clawdbot to operate inside live meetings, using real-time transcripts and chat events as input for proactive assistance and meeting knowledge capture.

Proposed solution

Integrate Clawdbot with Vexa as a real-time meeting data source.

Vexa streams transcript chunks (text, timestamp, speaker) and meeting chat events

Events are ingested by Clawdbot and bound to a short-lived meeting session

Clawdbot reasons over the live meeting and acts proactively

Outputs:

Private guidance to the meeting owner via existing Clawdbot channels (WhatsApp / Telegram / Slack)

Optional public outputs back into the meeting (decisions, action items, summaries)

Meeting context is isolated and does not pollute long-term memory.

Alternatives considered

Keeping Clawdbot limited to post-meeting or chat-only workflows

Implementing meeting intelligence entirely outside Clawdbot
