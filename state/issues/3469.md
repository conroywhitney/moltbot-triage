https://docs.molt.bot/concepts/models#switching-models-in-chat-/model

                                                                                                                                                                     
 ```markdown                                                                                                                                                         
   ## Bug Description                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                     
   `/model status` should show detailed model information (auth candidates, provider endpoint baseUrl, api mode), but instead it tries to set the model to `status`, 
 resulting in an error.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                     
   ## Expected Behavior                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                     
   Per the documentation:                                                                                                                                            
   > /model status is the detailed view (auth candidates and, when configured, provider endpoint baseUrl + api mode).                                                
                                                                                                                                                                     
   ## Actual Behavior                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                     
 ```                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                     
 model set failed: Error: model not allowed: anthropic/status                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                     
 ```                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                     
   The command parser interprets `status` as a model name and attempts to resolve it as `anthropic/status`.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                     
   ## Steps to Reproduce                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                     
   1. Run `/model status` in any channel
