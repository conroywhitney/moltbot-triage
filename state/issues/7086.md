## Description

Hey, I run OpenClaw on a Raspberry Pi (Node v22) and I noticed a bug with the WhatsApp channel.

When I send a file or image to the bot, it detects the `<media:document>` tag in the message content, but it doesn't seem to actually save the file anywhere. The connector isn't providing a local file path, so the bot can't process the attachment at all.

Is this a known issue with the WhatsApp adapter? Would appreciate any fix for this so I can handle PDF uploads.

Thanks!
