## Description

I tried out https://docs.clawd.bot/render

Tried re-deploying a couple times and got the same issue

This still happens on latest version

Maybe something changed after this was first tested where it isn't listening on any ports by default?

> Closing: Bug report missing critical information. Only 233 characters with no explanation of the actual error, steps to reproduce, environment details, or logs. Please open a new issue with the complete bug report template filled out.

Steps to reproduce, error logs, env details, logs are all in this other issue https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/3754, which you closed because it was a duplicate of this one. You then closed this one because there are "no details" 😞

Also, the issue is really simple: following documented instructions from the link I provided to see that Render deployment does not work as advertised. 

If it works for anyone out of the box, then I would be happy to see this closed with "cannot reproduce". 

But I expect you'll see the same as me. 

And it's incorrect that I didn't give details like Environment.
