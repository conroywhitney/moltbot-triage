## Description

## Summary
Model switching via the UI model picker (and `/model ...` command) appears ineffective and/or the UI status header shows a stale/incorrect model. We repeatedly selected **Opus 4.5** (and later **GPT-5.2**) but the session status line continued to show **claude-haiku-4-5** and the display looked inconsistent/broken.

## What we’re seeing
- UI status header shows something like:
  - `connected | idle agent main | session main (whatsapp:g-agent-main-main) | anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 | tokens 56k/200k (28%)`
- Switching the model in the UI (e.g. selecting `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`) does not reliably change what the UI reports, and may not change the model actually responding.
- There’s also a general “display is broken” symptom when attempting model changes (status/header not updating, inconsistent model/context reporting).

## Steps to reproduce
1. Start/continue a session (agent `main`).
2. Use the UI model picker to select `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` (Opus 4.5).
   - Alternatively run `/model opus`.
3. Observe that the status header continues to show `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (and a 200k context window), and the UI does not reflect the selected model.
4. Repeat with another model (e.g. `openai-codex/gpt-5.2`).

## Expected
- The selected model is applied to subsequent assistant responses.
- The UI status/header updates to reflect the *actual* model in use.
- CLI status (`… status`) and UI status agree on the session model and context window.

## Actual
- Status/header remains stuck on `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`.
- Model picker and/or `/model` command does not appear to take effect reliably.
- Model/context information appears inconsistent across status surfaces.

## Environment
- Version: `2026.1.24-3`
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu), Node v22.x
- Session key: `agent:main:main`

## Notes / Hypothesis
It looks like the status header may be reading from cached metadata or an agent default (possibly the heartbeat model) rather than the per-session override / live runtime model. Fixing this likely requires:
- Ensuring model selection updates the session runtime and persisted metadata
- Ensuring the status header reads from the same source of truth as the actual responder

Happy to provide more logs if you tell us which debug command/output is most useful.
