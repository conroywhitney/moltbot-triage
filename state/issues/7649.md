## Description

## Summary

After manually configuring JSON to get openclaw connected to a Matrix server, it cannot verify its own account - so it can't participate in e2ee channels.

## Steps to reproduce

1. register to matrix server
2. invite the agent
3. all messages are delivered with an unverified warning

## Expected behavior

docs say the bot will verify itself

## Actual behavior

I see this error in the logs:
"TypeError: client.crypto.requestOwnUserVerification is not a function"

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.2.1
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): web shell script
