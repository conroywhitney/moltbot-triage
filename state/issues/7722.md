## Description

**Feature:** Filesystem access restrictions via configuration

**What happened:**
We attempted to implement filesystem sandboxing with this config:
```javascript
{
  "tools": {
    "fileAccess": {
      "allowedPaths": ["/home/seraph/.openclaw/workspace", "/tmp"],
      "denyPaths": ["/etc", "/root", "~/.ssh", "/var/log"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```
Invalid config at /home/seraph/.openclaw/openclaw.json:
- tools: Unrecognized key: "fileAccess"
```

**Current behavior:**
Agents have unrestricted filesystem access (limited only by OS user permissions).

**Requested behavior:**
```javascript
"tools": {
  "fileAccess": {
    "mode": "sandbox",  // or "full" for current behavior
    "allowedPaths": [
      "/home/user/workspace",
      "/tmp",
      "~/.config",
      "~/.cache"
    ],
    "denyPaths": [
      "/etc/*",
      "/root",
      "~/.ssh",
      "/var/log",
      "/usr/bin",
      "/usr/sbin",
      "/boot",
      "/sys"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**
- `mode: "sandbox"` — enforce path restrictions
- `allowedPaths` — whitelist of accessible directories (recursive)
- `denyPaths` — blacklist that overrides allowedPaths (defense in depth)
- File operations outside allowed paths return error without execution
- Works with read, write, exec tools

**Why this matters:**
- OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 #A03 (Excessive Agent Autonomy)
- Prevents agents from reading `/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `/root/.secrets/`
- Defense in depth: even if an agent is compromised, filesystem damage is contained

**Example attack prevention:**
```javascript
// Attacker tries prompt injection to exfiltrate SSH keys
agent.exec("cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa")
// With fileAccess.denyPaths: ["~/.ssh"]
// → Error: Access denied to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Workaround:**
None. We're relying on OS-level user permissions (running as non-root `seraph` user).

**Related:** Part of our response to Palo Alto Networks' claim that OpenClaw is fundamentally insecure. #7720
