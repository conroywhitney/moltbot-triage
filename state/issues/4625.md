## Description

So, since every is using OpenClaw (formally Moltbot (formally Clawdbot)).

I was thinking what if we (most of us) assign one sub agent (good one) to pickup the issues from github and work on it, and one super agent (good model) can verify/ validate the changes and then @steipete can over look and merge it !!

It would speedup the validate and iterate cycle!

Just a thought, would love your inputs!
