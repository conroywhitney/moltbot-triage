## Description

## Description

When using `openrouter/auto` as the default model, messages fail with:

```
Error: Unknown model: openrouter/auto
```

## Root Cause

Model ref parsing mismatch between Clawdbot and pi-ai:

1. **pi-ai stores the model** under `modelRegistry["openrouter"]["openrouter/auto"]`
2. **Clawdbot's `parseModelRef()`** splits at first `/` → `provider="openrouter", model="auto"`
3. **Lookup fails**: `getModel("openrouter", "auto")` returns undefined

## Expected Behavior

`openrouter/auto` should work. OpenRouter's API accepts `model: "openrouter/auto"` for their auto-routing.

## Workaround

Use a specific model instead of `openrouter/auto` as default.

## Environment

- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
- Node: v22.22.0

## Suggested Fix

Handle special case where model ID includes provider prefix (like `openrouter/auto`).

### @nonwiz (2026-01-30)

Apparently, it you use `openrouter/openrouter/auto` it would work.

### @manymanik (2026-01-31)

did it work by using openrouter/openrouter/auto? @nonwiz I am trying to use kimi k2.5 but I keep getting a similar error.

### @saadzimat430 (2026-01-31)

same @manymanik can't get kimi k2.5 to work via openrouter

### @nonwiz (2026-01-31)

@manymanik  yeah `openrouter/openrouter/auto` works fine, I guess kimi k2.5 is not supported yet atm.

### @saadzimat430 (2026-01-31)

@nonwiz @manymanik the issue is resolved now after their latest release today https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.1.30
