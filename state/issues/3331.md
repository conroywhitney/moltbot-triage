## Description

## Description

When trying to attach the Browser Relay extension to a tab, it shows "relay not running" error unless you start from the extension's options page first.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install the Browser Relay extension via `clawdbot browser extension install`
2. Load unpacked in Chrome
3. Open any regular webpage (e.g., google.com)
4. Click the Browser Relay extension icon
5. **Result:** Shows "relay not running (open..." error

## Expected Behavior

Extension should attach to any tab when clicked, showing badge "ON".

## Actual Behavior

Extension only works when:
1. First opening the extension options page (`chrome-extension://[id]/options.html`)
2. Clicking the extension icon on that page
3. Then navigating from there

## Workaround

Start from the extension options page, attach there, then navigate to desired URL.

## Environment

- Chrome: Latest
- Relay shows "reachable" on options page
