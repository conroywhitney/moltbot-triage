## Description

Hello,

I am experiencing a severe and persistent failure when using the browser tool for web automation in my OpenClaw environment. All interaction attempts (like type or click) consistently fail with a 20-second timeout.

*The persistent error message is:*
Can't reach the openclaw browser control service (timed out after 20000ms).

*System Environment Details:*
*   *OS:* Windows 10.0.26200 (x64)
*   *OpenClaw Version:* 2026.1.29
*   *Gateway Binding:* Local Loopback (127.0.0.1:18789)

*Troubleshooting Steps Taken (All failed to resolve the issue):*

1.  *Browsers Tested:*
    *   Default Chrome
    *   Microsoft Edge (via executablePath)
    *   Comet Browser (via executablePath)
2.  *Profiles/Modes Tested:*
    *   openclaw profile (isolated)
    *   openclaw profile in headless: true mode
    *   chrome profile with manual attachment via the *Browser Relay extension* (resulted in "no tab is connected" errors, despite the extension being installed and the tab being active).
3.  *System/Security Checks:*
    *   Repeated Gateway restarts (openclaw gateway restart).
    *   Full deletion and recreation of the openclaw browser user data profile.
    *   *Full temporary disablement of Windows Firewall and all Antivirus software* (the failure persisted).

*Current Conclusion:*
The failure is systemic and does not appear to be caused by configuration or external security software. It seems there is a low-level host issue preventing stable, timely communication via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) on the local loopback address.

*I am requesting assistance with:*
1.  Identifying the specific Windows environmental issue causing this CDP/Loopback communication failure.
2.  Guidance on running deeper diagnostic tools (like netstat analysis or advanced Chrome logging) to pinpoint the root cause of the timeout.
