## Description

## Use Case

When the machine is off (or the gateway isn't running) at the time a scheduled cron job should fire, the job is silently skipped. For one-shot reminders, this means they're lost entirely.

## Proposed Behavior

On gateway startup, check all cron jobs:
- Compare `lastRun` (or last known execution time) with the job's schedule
- If a job *should* have fired while the gateway was down, trigger it now (or mark it for immediate execution)

This is similar to how `anacron` handles missed jobs on Linux systems.

## Configuration

Could be opt-in per job or global:
- `catchUp: true` on individual jobs
- Or a global `cron.catchUpMissed: true` setting

## Notes

Particularly useful for:
- One-shot reminders (currently lost if machine is off)
- Daily tasks that should always run, even if the machine was off overnight

## Comments

### @hbraak (2026-01-30)

**Additional thought:** Instead of automatically catching up, the gateway should *ask* the user whether to run the missed job.

Example prompt on startup:
> ⏰ Missed job: "Remind about 14:00 meeting" (was scheduled for 13:45, 3h ago)  
> Run now? [yes/no/skip all]

This way:
- Time-sensitive reminders can be skipped if no longer relevant
- Important tasks (daily backups, etc.) can still be triggered
- User stays in control

Could also have a per-job setting: `onMiss: ask | run | skip`
