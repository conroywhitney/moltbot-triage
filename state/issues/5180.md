## Logs or screenshots
Embedded agent failed before reply: All models failed (2): openrouter/x-ai/grok-4.1-fast: Provider openrouter is in cooldown (all profiles unavailable) (rate_limit) | openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5: Provider openrouter is in cooldown (all profiles unavailable) (rate_limit)

## Temporary Workaround

1. Navigate to your agent config directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent
   ```

2. Open the auth profiles file:
   ```bash
   nano auth-profiles.json
   ```

3. Locate and delete the entire `"usageStats"` field (including its contents)

4. Save the file and exit

5. Restart the gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway --force
   ```

This is an interesting issue about the OpenRouter provider getting stuck when credits run out. A few observations:

1. **Rate Limiting vs Credits**: The error message shows "Provider openrouter is in cooldown (all profiles unavailable) (rate_limit)" - this appears to be a rate limiting issue rather than just a credit problem. It might be good to clarify if this is specifically about credits or rate limits.

2. **Cache/State Management**: The workaround involves deleting the `usageStats` field from the auth profiles. This suggests there might be stale cached state that isn't being properly cleared when credits are refilled. 

3. **User Feedback**: The issue mentions "no warnings or indicators in tui or dashboard" - it would be helpful to add user-facing indicators when a provider is in cooldown or out of credits.

4. **Automatic Recovery**: Consider if the system should automatically attempt recovery after the user refills credits, rather than requiring manual intervention.

This seems like a good candidate for improving error handling and provider state management.
