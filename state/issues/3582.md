## Description

## Feature Request

When using Telegram's threaded conversations (forum topics) in private chats, new topics get a default name like "New Chat". It would be great if Clawdbot could rename these topics.

### Proposed solutions (any or all):

1. **Tool action** — Add a `renameTopic` or `editForumTopic` action to the Telegram message tool, e.g.:
   ```json
   {
     "action": "editTopic",
     "channel": "telegram",
     "chatId": "123456789",
     "threadId": "42",
     "name": "Project Discussion"
   }
   ```

2. **Command** — A `/topic rename <name>` command that renames the current topic.

3. **Auto-naming** — Optionally auto-generate a topic name from the first message or conversation summary (like how ChatGPT names conversations).

### Context

Telegram Bot API supports [`editForumTopic`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#editforumtopic) which allows setting the topic name and icon. This is available for both group forums and private chat topics.
