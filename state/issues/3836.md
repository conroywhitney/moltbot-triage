## Description

## Summary
Allow configurable retention policies based on session type (main, thread, DM, etc.).

## Motivation
- Different session types have different value/longevity
- Main sessions often contain important ongoing context
- Thread sessions may be more ephemeral
- Users want fine-grained control over what gets kept

## Proposed Features

### Configurable Retention by Session Kind

```yaml
sessions:
  retention:
    main: "forever"       # Never auto-delete
    thread: "7d"          # Delete after 7 days inactive
    dm: "30d"             # Delete after 30 days inactive
    isolated: "1d"        # Delete after 1 day
    default: "14d"        # Default for other types
```

### Additional Options
- `maxSessions`: Limit total sessions (LRU eviction)
- `maxSessionsPerKind`: Per-type limits
- `retentionByChannel`: Channel-specific policies

## Use Cases
1. Keep main session forever for persistent assistant memory
2. Auto-cleanup ephemeral thread sessions
3. Longer retention for DM conversations with important context

## Additional Context
Combined with session pinning, this would give users full control over session lifecycle management.
