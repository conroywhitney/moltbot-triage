## Description

## Problem

Currently, the agent configuration schema supports these fields:
- `id`, `name`, `workspace`, `agentDir`, `model`, `identity`, `tools`, `heartbeat`, `subagents`

However, there's **no `description` field** to describe what each agent specializes in.

## Use Case: Dynamic Agent Discovery

When orchestrating multiple sub-agents (Sisters), the main agent needs to:
1. List available agents via `agents_list()`
2. **Understand what each agent is good at**
3. Select the best agent for a given task
4. Delegate via `sessions_spawn()`

Without a `description` field, the orchestrator agent has no way to know what each sub-agent specializes in at runtime. This forces workarounds like:
- Hardcoding a static catalog in the main agent's system prompt
- Reading each agent's SOUL.md file manually (slow, fragile)

## Proposed Solution

Add an optional `description` field to agent config:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "trading",
      "name": "Trading Sister",
      "description": "Polymarket trading, market analysis, edge detection, bet execution",
      "workspace": "...",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

And include it in the `agents_list()` tool response.

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic orchestration** - Main agent can intelligently select sub-agents based on task requirements
2. **Self-documenting** - Agent capabilities are declared in config, not scattered across files
3. **Scalable** - Adding new agents doesn't require updating the orchestrator's system prompt

## Impact

This would be a significant capability upgrade for multi-agent setups, enabling truly dynamic agent selection rather than hardcoded routing.
