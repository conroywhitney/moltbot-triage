## Description

## Bug Description

When using `sessions_spawn` to run a sub-agent task, the result returns "(no output)" even though the sub-agent successfully completed the task and generated output.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Spawn a sub-agent with a research task:
```javascript
sessions_spawn({
  task: "Research Hong Kong IPO: Zhuozheng Medical (02677.HK). Search latest info, analyze IPO price, cornerstone investors, etc.",
  label: "ipo-research"
})
```

2. Wait for completion notification
3. Notification shows: `Findings: (no output)`

## Actual Behavior

- Sub-agent executes successfully (web searches, analysis)
- Sub-agent generates complete output (1759 tokens of formatted report)
- But `sessions_spawn` returns "(no output)"

## Expected Behavior

The final assistant message should be captured and returned as the result.

## Evidence

Checking sub-agent's session history via `sessions_history`:
- Last message contains full 1759-token research report
- `stopReason: "stop"` (completed normally)
- All tool calls executed successfully

## Environment

- OpenClaw: 2026.1.30 (76b5208)
- Model: claude-opus-4-5

## Session IDs (for debugging)

- Sub-agent sessionKey: `agent:main:subagent:4215c864-27ef-41bd-bed2-e909ac7d34c1`
- Transcript: `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/36771b02-d583-48cd-aa99-80bf5eabe1fa.jsonl`
