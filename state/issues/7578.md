## Description

## Summary
Control UI submit panel has broken layout on narrow viewports (mobile screen width) - placeholder text wraps awkwardly across multiple lines.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open Control UI webchat on a mobile device or resize browser to ~390px width
2. Navigate to any chat session
3. Observe the submit panel at bottom of screen

## Expected behavior
Submit panel (message input, New session button, Send button) should have proper responsive layout on narrow screens - placeholder text should truncate or reflow gracefully.

## Actual behavior
- Message input placeholder text "Message (↵ to send, Shift+↵ for line breaks, paste images)" wraps awkwardly across 5+ lines
- Layout looks cramped and unprofessional on mobile viewports

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Gateway OS: macOS (darwin)
- Client: 390px viewport width (iPhone 14 Pro equivalent)
- Install method: brew

## Screenshots
