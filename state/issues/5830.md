## Description

## Description

After updating to v2026.1.30, the dashboard logo appears as a broken image (placeholder icon).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Update to v2026.1.30: `npm i -g openclaw@latest`
2. Open the Gateway Dashboard
3. Observe the broken image icon where the logo should be

## Expected Behavior

The OpenClaw logo should display correctly in the dashboard header.

## Actual Behavior

A broken image placeholder is shown instead of the logo.

## Environment

- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.1.30
- **Node.js:** v22.22.0
- **OS:** Linux 6.8.12-16-pve (x64)
- **Install Method:** npm global

## Screenshot

The logo area shows the default broken image icon (mountain/landscape placeholder).

## Notes

- The `ui.assistant.avatar` config option exists but is not set by default
- Could not find logo assets in the npm package (`/assets/` directory)
- Previous version (2026.1.29) may have had the same issue (not confirmed)

PR #5674 should fix this — it switches to a local logo to prevent CDN errors.
