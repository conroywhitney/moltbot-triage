## Description

## Problem

An agent running inside a session cannot programmatically trigger , , or  on its own session. These commands must come from an authorized sender on the channel, creating a limitation for autonomous session management.

## Use Case

**Context-aware session management**: When an agent detects a topic switch or high context usage, it should be able to reset its own session and restore relevant context from files, rather than burning tokens carrying unrelated history forward.

This enables more intelligent context management where the agent can:
- Detect when conversation context is becoming too large or off-topic
- Proactively manage its own session lifecycle
- Restore only relevant context from files after a reset

## Current Workaround

The agent must ask the user to manually send , which breaks conversational flow and requires human intervention for what should be an autonomous optimization.

## Proposed Solution

Introduce a tool or internal API (e.g.,  or ) that allows an agent to trigger a reset/compact on its current session. This tool should support:

- **Self-triggering**: Agent can reset its own session without external authorization
- **Context restoration**: Optional parameter to inject a message into the new session for context restoration
- **Session types**: Support for both  (full reset) and  (context compression)

Example API:


## Benefits

This would enable skills like  to actually **manage context size**, not just organize notes. Agents could implement intelligent context management patterns, improving both performance and cost efficiency.
