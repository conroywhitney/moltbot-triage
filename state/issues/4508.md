## Description

## Description

Slack MPIM (multi-person direct message / Group DM) messages are not being received by Clawdbot, even when:
- The bot is a confirmed member of the MPIM
- Messages exist in the channel (verified via `conversations.history` API)
- The Slack app has correct scopes (`mpim:history`, `mpim:read`, `mpim:write`)
- The Slack app has `message.mpim` event subscription enabled

Regular DMs and channel messages work fine. Only MPIMs are affected.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Slack app with Socket Mode enabled
2. Add bot scopes: `mpim:history`, `mpim:read`, `mpim:write`
3. Subscribe to `message.mpim` event
4. Create a Group DM (MPIM) that includes the bot
5. Send a message @mentioning the bot in the MPIM
6. Observe: no log entry, no response from Clawdbot

## Expected Behavior

Clawdbot should receive and process `message.mpim` events just like `message.channels` and `message.im` events.

## Actual Behavior

- No log entry for incoming MPIM messages
- Messages verified to exist via REST API (`conversations.history`)
- Bot confirmed as member (`conversations.info` shows `is_member: true`, `is_mpim: true`)
- Socket Mode connected (other events work)

## Environment

- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Node version:** v25.4.0
- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 24.6.0 arm64)
- **Slack workspace:** Enterprise Grid

## Channel Info

```json
{
  "id": "{{ removed }}",
  "name": "mpdm-{{ removed }}",
  "is_mpim": true,
  "is_group": false,
  "is_private": true,
  "is_im": false,
  "is_channel": true,
  "is_member": true
}
```

## Logs

Gateway logs show no incoming message event for the MPIM. Compare to regular channel messages which show `skipping channel message` with reason, or DMs which are processed normally.

## Workaround

None currently. Private channels (non-MPIM) may work as an alternative for multi-person conversations.

yeah same issue here as well. really want that functionality working

### @myra-tapcart (2026-01-30)

## Root Cause Found & Fix

**The issue:** Slack MPIM (Group DM) events are silently dropped because `groupDmEnabled` defaults to `false` in Clawdbot's Slack channel config.

**Location:** `slack/monitor/context.js` line ~139:
```javascript
if (isGroupDm && !params.groupDmEnabled)
    return false;
```

This is controlled by `dmConfig?.groupEnabled ?? false` in `slack/monitor/provider.js` line 70.

**The fix:** Add `channels.slack.dm.groupEnabled: true` to your config:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "dm": {
        "enabled": true,
        "groupEnabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Suggestion for Clawdbot:** Consider either:
1. Documenting this setting prominently in the Slack channel docs
2. Defaulting `groupEnabled` to `true` (or inheriting from `dm.enabled`)
3. Adding a warning log when MPIM events are dropped due to this setting

Tested and confirmed working on v2026.1.24-3.
