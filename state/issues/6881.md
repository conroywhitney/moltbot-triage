## Description

## Summary

The Telegram channel plugin can crash the entire gateway when network errors occur during the Grammy.js runner initialization phase.

## Root Cause

1. The `run()` call in `monitor.ts` is outside the try-catch block, so initialization errors aren't caught
2. The error message pattern "fetch failed sending request" isn't recognized as a recoverable network error
3. The unhandled rejections handler uses exact match instead of `startsWith()` for fetch error messages

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure telegram channel in openclaw
2. Start gateway when network is unavailable or DNS cannot resolve
3. Gateway crashes instead of retrying with backoff

## Expected Behavior

Gateway should log the network error and retry with exponential backoff, same as it does for errors during polling.

## Affected Files

- `src/telegram/monitor.ts`
