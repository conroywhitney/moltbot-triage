## Description

## Description

When the macOS OpenClaw app is quit while an agent task is running, the task is immediately aborted, even though the gateway service continues running under launchd.

## Expected Behavior

According to the documentation in `docs/platforms/mac/bundled-gateway.md`:

> "App quit does **not** stop the gateway (launchd keeps it alive)."

Since the gateway is an independent service managed by launchd, running tasks should continue executing in the background. When the user reopens the app, they should see the completed results.

## Actual Behavior

1. Agent is executing multiple `exec` tool calls (e.g., git clone commands)
2. User quits the macOS app (Cmd+Q or menu quit)
3. The running tool calls immediately return `synthetic error` results:
   ```json
   {"error":"[openclaw] missing tool result in session history; inserted synthetic error result for transcript repair."}
   ```
4. The task is effectively aborted

## Environment

- OpenClaw app: 2026.1.30 (8469)
- Mode: local
- Gateway managed by: launchd (`ai.openclaw.gateway`)
- macOS

## Reproduction

1. Start a long-running agent task (e.g., cloning multiple git repos)
2. Quit the OpenClaw app while task is in progress
3. Reopen the app
4. Observe that the task was interrupted, not completed

## Impact

This is problematic for:
- Long-running tasks that take several minutes
- Accidental app quits
- Users who expect background execution

## Suggestion

The gateway should continue executing the current agent task even when the app connection is lost, and surface the results when the app reconnects.
