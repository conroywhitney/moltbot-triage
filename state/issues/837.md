## Description

## Description

When starting a dev server with the script:

```
"gate": "bun clawdbot --dev gateway"
```

And then stopping it with Ctrl+C, the shell remains in some special state.

Note: clawdbot is installed as dev dependency, so running this bun clawdbot runs it as node (i confirmed with macos activity monitor by killing node processes and seeing the dev gateway vanisch)

## Surprising Behavior

When pressing Ctrl+C again after the process ended, it prints these escape sequences:

```
^C^C
```

## Expected Behavior

Not printing anything when pressing Ctrl+C on an empty prompt.

## Environment

- Terminal: Zed
- Zed version: 0.218.7 – /Applications/Zed.app
- Shell: fish

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `bun clawdbot --dev gateway` in Zed terminal
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop the process
3. Press Ctrl+C again on the empty prompt
4. Observe escape sequences being printed

## Additional Notes

This issue appears to be related to how the process handles SIGINT and restores terminal settings. May be related to signal handling or process cleanup in the gateway startup/shutdown logic.

## Comments

This issue also happens in Ghostty, but the printed sequence is different when pressing Ctrl+C on the empty prompt.

**Hotfix:** Pressing Enter resets the shell to a correct empty prompt.
