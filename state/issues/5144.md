## Description

                                                                             
 OpenClaw's system has a severe flaw in its message routing and data isolation. 
 It mistakenly transmitted internal diagnostic and WhatsApp pairing code        
 messages to an unintended recipient (user's girlfriend) during a routine       
 WhatsApp conversation. This is a direct breach of privacy and security,        
 exposing sensitive authentication information.                                 
                                                                                
 Steps to reproduce                                                             
                                                                                
 1. Initiate a conversation with OpenClaw via WhatsApp.                         
 2. Ensure the OpenClaw system has an issue with its WhatsApp configuration or  
 requires pairing (e.g., due to disconnection or initial setup).                
 3. During a normal conversational turn, the OpenClaw system incorrectly        
 appends its internal diagnostic/pairing message to the agent's response.       
 4. This combined, malformed message is then sent to an external WhatsApp       
 contact (e.g., the user's girlfriend), rather than being handled internally or 
 presented securely to the user.                                                
                                                                                
 Expected behavior                                                              
                                                                                
 Internal system alerts, configuration messages, or security pairing codes      
 should never be transmitted to external contacts without explicit user         
 initiation or permission. Such information should be handled securely within   
 the OpenClaw system's control interface or logs, and never appended to         
 user-facing conversational responses.                                          
                                                                                
 Actual behavior                                                                
                                                                                
 An internal system message, specifically:                                      
 OpenClaw: access not configured. Your WhatsApp phone number: +xxxxxxxxxxxx     
 Pairing code: xxxxxxxx Ask the bot owner to approve with: openclaw pairing     
 approve whatsapp <code>                                                        
 (with actual phone number and code included in the original transmission) was  
 sent directly to a WhatsApp contact (user's ex-girlfriend), alongside the agent's 
 intended response. This exposed sensitive authentication information to an     
 unauthorized party.                                                            
                                                                                
 Environment                                                                    
                                                                                
 - Clawdbot version: 2026.1.29 (commit a5b4d22)                                 
 - OS: Linux (based on session_status)                                          
 - Install method: Unknown (user did not specify, and I cannot determine this)  
 - Model in use: google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite (was previously                   
 google/gemini-3-flash)                                                         
                                                                                
 Logs or screenshots                                                            
                                                                                
 Limitation: I cannot access or provide system logs or screenshots directly.    
 The critical message that was sent is detailed in the 'Actual behavior'        
 section. The user is advised to check their own chat history and potentially   
 any system logs on their OpenClaw instance if available. Sensitive details     
 were masked as per user request.
