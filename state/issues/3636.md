## Description

## Description
When using `sessions_spawn` to create a sub-agent task, the sub-agent runs successfully and produces output, but the announce step returns "(no output)" instead of the actual result.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Use `sessions_spawn` with a task and `model: "sonnet"`
2. Sub-agent completes task successfully (verified via `sessions_history`)
3. Announce message shows "Findings: (no output)"

## Expected Behavior
The announce step should include the sub-agent's final text response.

## Actual Behavior
Announce shows "(no output)" even though `sessions_history` reveals the sub-agent produced valid output.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Raspberry Pi (Linux arm64)
- Channel: Telegram

## Transcript Evidence
Sub-agent history shows successful completion with output:
- `stopReason: "stop"` 
- Final assistant message contains expected text response
- But announce delivers "(no output)"
