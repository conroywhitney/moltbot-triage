## Description

## Bug

Several standard Emacs/readline key bindings are broken in the TUI input editor — some are unhandled, one is intercepted by a TUI shortcut.

### Working bindings
- ✅ `Ctrl+A` (beginning of line)
- ✅ `Ctrl+E` (end of line)
- ✅ `Ctrl+K` (kill to end of line)
- ✅ `Meta+F` (forward word)
- ✅ `Meta+B` (backward word)

### Broken bindings
- ❌ `Ctrl+B` (backward char) — does nothing
- ❌ `Ctrl+F` (forward char) — does nothing
- ❌ `Ctrl+D` (delete char) — mapped to "exit TUI" instead

## Expected behavior

- `Ctrl+B` moves cursor one character left
- `Ctrl+F` moves cursor one character right
- `Ctrl+D` deletes the character under the cursor (when input is non-empty)

Note: `Ctrl+D` sending EOF/exit on an **empty** input is standard terminal behavior and fine to keep. The issue is that it exits even when there is text in the editor, where Emacs users expect `delete-char`.

## Environment

- OpenClaw TUI
- macOS (Terminal / iTerm2)
