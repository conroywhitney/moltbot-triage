## Description

## Description

When Moltbot's WhatsApp gateway is connected via Baileys, my iPhone stops receiving push notifications for new WhatsApp messages. This does NOT happen with WhatsApp Web, only with Moltbot.

## Current Behavior

- Gateway connects -> Phone notifications are suppressed
- Messages are received by the gateway, but my phone doesn't show notifications
- `sendReadReceipts: false` is already configured but doesn't help

## Expected Behavior

Phone should still receive push notifications even when the gateway is connected (like WhatsApp Web does).

## Root Cause Analysis <a

I compared Moltbot with another Baileys-based tool I built that does NOT suppress notifications. The key difference is these Baileys socket options:

```javascript
const sock = makeWASocket({
    markOnlineOnConnect: false,    // Don't show "online" status
    emitOwnEvents: false,          // Don't emit own events
});

// After connection opens:
await sock.sendPresenceUpdate('unavailable');  // Appear offline
```

Without these options, WhatsApp treats the linked device as "active" and suppresses phone notifications.

## Proposed Solution

Add configuration options to enable "stealth mode" for WhatsApp:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "stealthMode": true
    }
  }
}
```

Or more granular options:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "markOnlineOnConnect": false,
      "presence": "unavailable"
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment

- Moltbot version: 2026.1.27-beta.1
- Platform: Docker on Windows
- Device: iPhone
