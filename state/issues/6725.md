## Description

## Description

The Gateway Dashboard shows a broken image and text overlap in the header/brand area.

## Root Cause

The logo image URL returns HTTP 403 Forbidden:

```
https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE&q=85&s=da2032e9eac3b5d9bfe7eb96ca6a8a26
```

```bash
$ curl -sI "https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg..."
HTTP/2 403
```

## Visual Result

- Broken image placeholder appears
- `alt="OpenClaw"` text renders below the broken icon
- Brand text ("OPENCLAW GATEWAY DASHBOARD") overlaps with the alt text

## Location in Code

`dist/control-ui/assets/index-*.js` contains the hardcoded CDN URL.

## Suggestion

Bundle the logo locally in the control-ui assets, or fix CDN access.

## Version

`openclaw --version`: 2026.1.30
