## Description

## Environment
- OpenClaw Mac app: v2026.1.30 (build 8469)
- macOS: 26.2.0 (arm64, Mac mini M4 Pro)
- Gateway: local mode
- Display: 3440x1440 ultrawide

## Description
Calling `screen.record` via the nodes API causes the OpenClaw Mac app to crash/disconnect immediately. The node reconnects seconds later, but every subsequent attempt also crashes.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Grant "Screen & System Audio Recording" permission to OpenClaw in System Settings → Privacy & Security
2. Restart the OpenClaw Mac app
3. Trigger `screen.record` from the gateway (e.g. via nodes tool with `durationMs: 1`)

## Observed Behavior
- The node disconnects instantly (~550-750ms) when `screen.record` is invoked
- Error: `errorCode=UNAVAILABLE errorMessage=Error: node disconnected (screen.record)`
- The app reconnects after a few seconds, but the crash repeats on every retry
- **One successful capture was observed** right after granting the permission, but all subsequent attempts crashed
- No macOS crash report (`.ips`) is generated — suggests the app disconnects the websocket rather than hard-crashing

## Expected Behavior
Screen recording should return a video/image file without crashing the app.

## Gateway Logs
```
[ws] ⇄ res ✗ node.invoke 688ms errorCode=UNAVAILABLE errorMessage=Error: node disconnected (screen.record)
[ws] ⇄ res ✗ node.invoke 691ms errorCode=UNAVAILABLE errorMessage=Error: node disconnected (screen.record)
[ws] ⇄ res ✗ node.invoke 556ms errorCode=UNAVAILABLE errorMessage=Error: node disconnected (screen.record)
[ws] ⇄ res ✗ node.invoke 570ms errorCode=UNAVAILABLE errorMessage=Error: node disconnected (screen.record)
[ws] ⇄ res ✗ node.invoke 755ms errorCode=UNAVAILABLE errorMessage=Error: node disconnected (screen.record)
```

Pattern: 5 consecutive failures, all disconnecting within 550-755ms of invocation.

## Notes
- `screenRecording: true` is correctly reported in node permissions
- The single successful capture produced a valid MP4 (3440x1440, h264, 0.3s)
- Killing and relaunching the app did not fix the issue
- Force-quitting and cold-starting also did not help
- Issue reproduces regardless of which channel (webchat or WhatsApp) triggers it

PR #5656 addresses macOS crashes and may resolve this screen.record issue.
