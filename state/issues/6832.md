## Description

## Problem

Currently, sub-agents spawned via `sessions_spawn` only have access to basic tools (read, write, edit, exec, process, image). They cannot spawn their own sub-agents.

This limits workflows where an Opus sub-agent doing complex reasoning might want to delegate simpler/bulk work to a cheaper model (e.g., a local vLLM instance).

## Proposed Solution

Allow sub-agents to optionally have `sessions_spawn` access, with safeguards:

1. **Depth limit** — Configure max spawn depth (e.g., `maxSpawnDepth: 2` means main→child→grandchild, no further)
2. **Model restrictions** — Sub-agents could be limited to spawning only on specific models (e.g., only local/free models)
3. **Opt-in per spawn** — Add a parameter like `allowChildSpawns: true` to `sessions_spawn`

## Use Case

- Main agent (Opus) spawns a research sub-agent (Opus) for complex reasoning
- Research sub-agent spawns multiple Nova workers for parallel data gathering
- Results bubble back up to main agent

This enables hierarchical delegation while keeping costs controlled.

## Alternatives Considered

- Main agent manually orchestrating all spawns (current workaround, but clunky)
- Pre-defining all sub-agents upfront (inflexible)

## Additional Context

Discovered this limitation while testing Opus→Nova delegation chains. The main agent can spawn to either model, but sub-agents cannot delegate further.
