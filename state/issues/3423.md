## Description

## 💡 Feature Request

**Support Google Cloud Search API / Custom Search JSON API for users with Google One AI Pro subscription**

### Background
Google One AI Pro subscribers (0/month) receive credits for Google Gen AI and Cloud services. It would be great if Clawdbot could leverage these existing credits for web search, similar to how it currently supports Brave Search API.

### Benefits
- Users already paying for Google One AI Pro can utilize their included credits
- No need for separate Brave Search API subscription
- Access to Google's search quality and freshness
- Better value for existing Google One subscribers

### Proposed Implementation
- Add support for Google Custom Search JSON API as an alternative to Brave Search
- Allow users to configure Google API credentials via `clawdbot configure --section web`
- Keep Brave Search as default option for those who prefer it

### Use Case
Many users already subscribe to Google One AI Pro for Gemini access and receive cloud/API credits as part of their subscription. Supporting Google Search API would let them maximize the value of their existing subscription without needing additional API keys.
