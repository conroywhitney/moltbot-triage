## Description

## Problem

The TUI footer displays token count and context usage (live session data), but shows a hardcoded provider name (e.g., "Anthropic") instead of the actual active model.

This is confusing because:
- The stats (tokens, context) are from the current session
- But the provider/model shown doesn't reflect the actual model in use
- When switching models via `/models`, the footer still shows the old/default provider

## Expected Behavior

The footer should display the **current session's active model** (e.g., `google/gemini-2.5-pro` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`), matching what `/status` or `session_status` reports.

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Windows TUI
- Model switched via `/models` to Google Gemini
