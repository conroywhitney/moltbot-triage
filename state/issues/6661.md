## Description

## Summary
Using Abacus RouteLLM with OpenClaw (api: openai-completions) results in tool calls being returned as plain text (no OpenAI function/tool_call objects). In addition, RouteLLM rejects the `strict` field in tool definitions with HTTP 400 "Validation Error: strict - Extra inputs are not permitted" unless it is stripped.

## Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.1.29
- Provider: routellm (Abacus)
- Base URL: https://routellm.abacus.ai/v1
- API: openai-completions
- Model: route-llm

## Observed behavior
1) Tool calls are not emitted as OpenAI-compatible tool/function call objects. The model responds with literal text like:
```
<function_call_name>write</function_call_name><function_call_arguments>{"path":"...","content":"..."}</function_call_arguments>
```
OpenClaw never executes the tool because the response is plain text.

2) When tools are sent, RouteLLM rejects `strict` inside tool definitions:
```
HTTP 400: "Validation Error: strict - Extra inputs are not permitted"
```

## Workaround
A tiny proxy that strips `strict` (and `tools[].function.strict`) from requests to RouteLLM fixes the 400 error. Tool calls still do not execute because RouteLLM does not return OpenAI tool-call objects.

## Expected behavior
- If RouteLLM is OpenAI-compatible, it should return tool calls in the OpenAI format so OpenClaw can execute tools.
- If `strict` is unsupported, it should be documented, or OpenClaw should have a provider compat flag to omit it for RouteLLM.

## Questions
- Does RouteLLM support OpenAI tool/function calls at all? If not, is there a documented way to enable them?
- Should OpenClaw add a compat option (e.g., `compat.supportsToolStrict=false`) for providers like RouteLLM?

Thanks!
