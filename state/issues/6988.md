## Description

## Summary

Jobs created via the `cron.add` tool (or API) are silently disabled because `enabled` is not set by default. The scheduler treats `undefined` as disabled, so jobs never run and `nextWakeAtMs` stays `null`.

## Reproduction

```bash
# 1. Add a job (no explicit enabled flag)
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Test job" \
  --cron "*/5 * * * *" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Test"

# 2. Check list (returns empty!)
openclaw cron list
# Output: { "jobs": [] }

# 3. Check status (shows job count but null wake time)
openclaw cron status
# Output: { "enabled": true, "jobs": 1, "nextWakeAtMs": null }

# 4. Check with includeDisabled
openclaw cron list --include-disabled
# Output: Shows the job (no `enabled` field present)

# 5. Fix by explicitly enabling
openclaw cron edit <jobId> --enabled

# 6. Now it works
openclaw cron list
# Output: Shows the job with nextRunAtMs computed
openclaw cron status  
# Output: nextWakeAtMs is now populated
```

## Expected behavior

Jobs should default to `enabled: true` when created, matching the behavior described in the docs:

> Optional: `enabled` (default true)

## Actual behavior

- `enabled` field is omitted entirely on creation
- Scheduler treats missing `enabled` as disabled
- Jobs silently never run
- `nextWakeAtMs` stays `null`
- `cron list` returns empty (without `--include-disabled`)

## Impact

This is a significant footgun — users create jobs expecting them to run, but they silently do nothing. No error, no warning.

## Suggested fix

In the job creation logic, default `enabled: true` when not explicitly provided.

## Environment
