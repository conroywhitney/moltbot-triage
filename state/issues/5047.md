## Description

## Problem

The macOS app has a "Browser Control" option in the context menu (right-click on menu bar icon) that can be toggled on. However, enabling it does **not** actually start the browser relay.

## Evidence

1. "Browser Control" is checked/enabled in the macOS app context menu
2. `lsof -i :18792` shows nothing listening on the browser relay port
3. Node status shows `caps: ["canvas", "screen"]` — no `browser` capability advertised
4. Gateway reports "No connected browser-capable nodes" when trying to use browser control

## Expected Behavior

When "Browser Control" is enabled:
- The browser relay should start listening on port 18792
- The node should advertise `browser` capability
- Browser automation should work through the macOS app node

## Current Workaround

Run the CLI node host separately (`openclaw node run`) which does support browser proxy. But this requires running two separate node processes.

## Environment

- macOS app version 2026.1.29
- Gateway running remotely via Tailscale
- `nodeHost.browserProxy.enabled: true` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
