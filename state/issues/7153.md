## Description

When the agent wraps a URL in markdown bold (`**https://example.com**`), the `**` characters get included in the tappable URL on WhatsApp, breaking the link.

**Expected:** URLs should be sent plain on WhatsApp, even if the agent wraps them in markdown formatting.

**Suggested fix:** Before sending on WhatsApp, strip bold/italic markers (`**`, `*`, `__`, `_`) that immediately surround a URL pattern (e.g. `https://...`).

This is a recurring issue since the LLM tends to emphasize URLs with bold formatting, which works on other platforms but breaks WhatsApp links.

### @lailoo (2026-02-02)

I addressed this issue in PR #7395

If you have some time, I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look.

**Solution:** Strip bold/italic markers (`**`, `*`, `__`, `_`) that immediately surround URLs before sending on WhatsApp.

**Examples:**
- `**https://example.com**` → `https://example.com`
- `*https://foo.bar/path*` → `https://foo.bar/path`

Non-URL bold/italic text is preserved.
