## Description

## Summary
The OpenClaw gateway currently uses static token-based authentication, which makes it harder to integrate with modern identity systems that provide SSO, MFA, and centralized user management. Native OIDC support would improve both security and usability.

## Proposed solution
Add optional **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** authentication to the gateway, allowing users to authenticate via an external IdP (e.g. Pocket ID, Authentik, Keycloak). Token-based auth could remain supported as a fallback.

## Alternatives considered
- Static token authentication only
- Handling OIDC externally via a reverse proxy

Native support would reduce complexity and improve integration.

## Additional context
Example use case: protecting the gateway with **Pocket ID** to avoid managing static tokens and enable passkeys/MFA. Implementation should remain generic and standards-compliant.
