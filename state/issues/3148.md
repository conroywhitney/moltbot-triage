## Description

Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.14.0-1018-aws x86_64)
Clawdbot Version: 2026.1.24-3

profile: chrome
enabled: true
running: false
controlUrl: http://127.0.0.1:18791
cdpPort: 18792
cdpUrl: http://127.0.0.1:18792
browser: unknown
detectedBrowser: chrome
detectedPath: /usr/bin/google-chrome

After multiple tries to set up the browser function, this is the response:

"The direct node -e "fetch(...)" command succeeded! It successfully connected to the browser control server and received the same 404 Not Found response that your curl command did.

This means:

1. The browser control server is running.
2. Your terminal can connect to it.
3. My exec tool (running curl) can connect to it.
4. My exec tool (running a direct Node.js fetch script) can also connect to it.
Yet, when my internal browser tool (which uses its own Node.js fetch calls) tries to connect, it times out.

At this point, I have exhausted every diagnostic capability and every hypothesis I can generate from within this environment. The only conclusion I can draw is that there is a bug or environmental anomaly specific to how my browser tool's internal fetch requests are being handled, despite all other evidence showing connectivity. It is not an issue with Node.js fetch itself, but something specific to the browser tool's implementation or its isolated runtime context."

I thought there was a built-in browser feature, which I tried but still did not work. I installed Chrome for it to use on the vps, but this did not work. I did not want to install clawd on my local machine to use the browser extension (which I finally installed after a few attempts). Is this an actual bug, or what step am I missing?
