## Description

## Use Case
I want to see the Chromium window while the Agent navigates (Validation, Debugging, or just 'watching it work'). On WSL2 (WSLg), this requires:
1.  Passing `DISPLAY=:0`.
2.  **Not** passing `--headless`.

## Current Limitation
OpenClaw currently hardcodes `headless: true` (or relies on Puppeteer defaults). To bypass this, I had to write a custom shim script that strips the `--headless` argument before calling Chromium.

## Proposal
1.  Add a `browser.headless` boolean to `openclaw.json`.
2.  (Optional) Detect WSL environment and suggest/auto-configure `DISPLAY` if missing.

I have a working proof-of-concept shim script available if needed for reference.
