## Description

## Summary

According to the docs, there should be a allowedControlHosts property in agents.defaults.sandbox.browser.
However, starting the gateway runs into an error ```Unrecognized key: "allowedControlHosts"```

## Expected behavior

I would like to be able to restrict Host-access for the sandbox browser to a number of specific hosts.

## Actual behavior

The config cannot be applied as the ```allowControlHosts``` property does not exist.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.2.1
- OS: Mac OS 26.2
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npm
- Openclaw runs sandboxed in docker container
