## Description

## Bug: No governance file consistency validation — silent drift between ranked documents

**Problem:**
OpenClaw supports ranked governance files (DAO, SOUL, AGENTS, etc.) that reference each other by section number, rang level, and cross-file pointers. After any edit, there is no mechanism to detect broken references, rang mismatches, or contradictions between files.

**Impact:**
Governance files silently drift out of sync after edits. Observed: SOUL.md said "Rang 2 under DAO + CONSTITUTION" after CONSTITUTION was deleted — persisted for days undetected. AGENTS.md referenced "CONSTITUTION section 12" which no longer existed. Boot-guard sequence in AGENTS.md did not include 2 of 6 ranked files. No automated check catches these — requires manual cross-file review. As governance grows (currently 6 files, 50KB+), manual review becomes impractical.

**Expected:** A validation tool that checks: cross-file references resolve, rang numbers are consistent, boot-guard sequence covers all ranked files, no references to deleted files/sections, file sizes within limits (write guard).

**Environment:** OpenClaw 2026.1.30, Windows 10, 6 governance files totaling ~50KB

**Workaround:** Manual CC review after each edit. Caught 6 blocking issues in one review — but only because a human triggered the review. No automation, no CI.
