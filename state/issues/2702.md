## Description

## Summary
Problem Description:
Any call to the browser tool (e.g., browser.start()) fails with a timeout error:
Can't reach the clawdbot browser control server at http://XXX.0.0.1:XXXXX/... (timed out after 15000ms).

This occurs despite the main gateway being active and reachable.

Troubleshooting Steps Performed:

1. Initial Failure: The first attempt to use the browser tool failed, indicating no browser was found.
2. Install Chromium: Installed chromium-browser via sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser.
3. Enable Browser Service: The browser service was not running. Patched the config via the gateway to set "browser": {"enabled": true}. The gateway was restarted.
4. systemd Debugging: Discovered the systemd service was not correctly configured. The process was being run manually. After a lengthy debugging session involving fnm's temporary paths and sudo's secure PATH, a correct and stable systemd service file was created, pointing directly to the node executable and the clawdbot entry.js script. The service now runs correctly as active (running).
5. Playwright Dependency Installation: Suspecting a Playwright-specific issue, we attempted to install its managed browser and dependencies. This required another extended debugging session due to sudo path issues with npx/pnpx.
6. Successful Playwright Install: We successfully ran the command sudo /path/to/pnpm dlx playwright install chromium --with-deps by temporarily creating a node symlink in /usr/local/bin. This confirmed Playwright's own browser and all system dependencies were installed.
7. Final Attempt: After restarting the now-correct systemd service, the browser.start() call still results in the same timeout error.
Hypothesis:
The browser control sub-service is silently crashing during the gateway's startup sequence. This failure does not bring down the main gateway process and does not appear to be logged anywhere accessible (the systemd journal for the service is clean). The issue is likely specific to the arm64 environment, possibly due to a native dependency or an assumption in the browser service's launch code.
