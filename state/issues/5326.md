## Description

## Bug Report

**Platform:** Linux (Ubuntu)
**Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
**Channel:** Telegram Bot

### Description
Telegram bot successfully sends outgoing messages, but incoming messages from allowlisted users are not reaching the agent.

### Current Configuration
```json
"telegram": {
  "enabled": true,
  "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
  "botToken": "<redacted>",
  "allowFrom": [
    "Recacted"
  ],
  "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
  "streamMode": "partial"
}
```

### What Works
- Agent → Telegram: Outgoing messages are delivered successfully
- Bot status shows: ON, OK, token config, accounts 1/1
- User can see the bot and receive messages

### What Doesn't Work
- Telegram → Agent: Incoming messages from allowlisted user () are ignored
- Messages including /start command are not received by the agent
- No inbound activity shown in logs for Telegram (only WhatsApp inbound works)

### Expected Behavior
When dmPolicy is set to "allowlist" and the user ID is in allowFrom, incoming messages from that user should be processed by the agent.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure Telegram with dmPolicy: "allowlist"
2. Add user ID to allowFrom
3. Agent sends test message to user → works
4. User replies or sends /start → not received

### Logs
- Gateway shows: Telegram default: enabled, configured, running, mode:polling, token:config
- No error logs related to Telegram inbound processing
- Cron jobs and other channels (WhatsApp) work normally

### Notes
- Bot token is valid (outgoing works)
- User ID xxx is correctly listed in allowFrom
- Tested after gateway restart - issue persists
- User confirmed they received test messages and replied, but replies never reached the agent

### Additional Context
This issue is blocking using Telegram as a backup channel to WhatsApp.
