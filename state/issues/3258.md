## Description

## Summary

When the agent needs exec approvals, it suggests the user run `clawdbot approve <id>` from the CLI - but this command does not exist. The correct way to approve is via the `/approve` slash command in chat.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Configure exec approvals with `ask: "on-miss"`
2. Have the agent try to run a command not in safeBins
3. Agent shows approval request with IDs
4. Agent suggests: `clawdbot approve 9c8cd40a ff263ea6`

## Expected behavior

Agent should suggest the correct approval method:
```
/approve 9c8cd40a allow-once
```

Or explain that approval can be done via:
- The `/approve` slash command in chat
- The Control UI dashboard
- The macOS app approval dialog

## Actual behavior

Agent suggests `clawdbot approve <id>` which returns:
```
error: unknown command 'approve'
(Did you mean approvals?)
```

## Root cause

The agent's knowledge (likely from workspace templates or system prompt) incorrectly describes the approval CLI interface.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.25
- Channel: Discord
- Install method: Nix (nix-clawdbot)
