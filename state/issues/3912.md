## Description

## Summary

Currently, the Discord plugin works in either "mentionsOnly" mode (requires @mention) or passive mode (receives all messages). Users would like the ability to set different mention modes per channel within the same server.

## Use Case

For example, in a Discord server:
- #general channel: passive listening (no @mention required)
- #other-channels: mentionsOnly mode (requires @mention)

## Expected Behavior

```
Allow configuration like:
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "guilds": {
        "123456789": {
          "channels": {
            "general": {
              "mode": "passive"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This would provide more flexibility for server administrators who want different interaction modes in different channels.
