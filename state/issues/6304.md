## Description

## Security Vulnerability Report

**Severity:** Moderate  
**CVE:** CVE-2023-28155 (GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6)  
**Affected Package:** request (<=2.88.2)  
**Status:** Known limitation - deprecated package, no patch available

### Summary

The optional Matrix channel plugin depends on `@vector-im/matrix-bot-sdk` which uses the deprecated `request` package. This package has a known Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2023-28155).

### Impact

- **Affected Users:** Only those who have installed the optional Matrix plugin
- **Main Application:** NOT affected - core OpenClaw functionality is secure
- **Exploitability:** Requires attacker-controlled server and specific conditions

### What Was Done

✅ **Fixed 5 other vulnerabilities** (1 critical, 1 high, 4 moderate):
- tough-cookie (prototype pollution) - patched via override
- form-data (CVE-2025-7783) - patched via override  
- qs (CVE-2025-15284) - patched via override
- hono (4 vulnerabilities) - upgraded to 4.11.7
- fast-xml-parser (CVE-2026-25128) - patched via override

### Remaining Work

The `request` package is deprecated and unmaintained. Options for the Matrix plugin:

1. **Wait for upstream fix:** `@vector-im/matrix-bot-sdk` needs to migrate to a maintained HTTP client (e.g., fetch, axios, got)
2. **Create custom patch:** Use pnpm patching to mitigate the vulnerability locally
3. **Accept risk:** Document as known issue for optional plugin users

### Recommendation

Document this as a known limitation for the optional Matrix plugin until the upstream dependency is updated. Users not using the Matrix plugin are unaffected.
