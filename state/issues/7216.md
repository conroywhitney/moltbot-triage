## Description

# Feature Request: Intelligent Task-Based Model Routing

## Summary

Add automatic task-complexity-based model scheduling that routes demanding tasks to more capable models and mundane tasks to simpler/cheaper models.

## Motivation

Currently, OpenClaw supports:
- Error-recovery fallbacks (`fallback: ["model1", "model2"]`)
- Per-agent model assignment
- Image model separation (`imageModel`)
- Per-session model overrides

However, there's no built-in mechanism to **automatically analyze task complexity and route accordingly**. This would be valuable for:

1. **Cost optimization** — Simple queries (weather, time, basic lookups) don't need expensive models
2. **Rate limit management** — Spread load across model tiers to avoid exhausting premium quotas
3. **Response speed** — Faster models for trivial tasks, powerful models only when needed

## Proposed Solution

### Option A: Declarative Tier Configuration

```yaml
models:
  routing:
    strategy: complexity  # or 'cost', 'latency', 'hybrid'
    tiers:
      - name: simple
        models: ["gemini-flash", "claude-haiku"]
        triggers:
          - simple_questions
          - status_checks
          - file_reads
      - name: standard
        models: ["claude-sonnet", "gpt-4o"]
        triggers:
          - code_generation
          - analysis
      - name: advanced
        models: ["claude-opus", "o1"]
        triggers:
          - complex_reasoning
          - multi_step_planning
          - research_tasks
```

### Option B: Task Classifier Hook

Allow a lightweight classifier (could be a fast LLM call or rule-based) to analyze incoming tasks and select the appropriate model tier.

```yaml
models:
  routing:
    classifier: "gemini-flash"  # Uses cheap model to classify task complexity
    fallbackTier: standard
```

### Option C: Escalation Pattern

Start with the cheapest model; if it signals uncertainty or the task requires more capability, escalate automatically.

```yaml
models:
  routing:
    strategy: escalate
    startWith: "gemini-flash"
    escalateTo: ["claude-sonnet", "claude-opus"]
    escalationTriggers:
      - confidence_low
      - tool_call_failed
      - explicit_request
```

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual per-agent configuration** — Works but requires users to predict task types per agent
- **Session-level overrides** — Reactive, not proactive; user must intervene
- **Custom skills** — Possible workaround but adds complexity

## Additional Context

This feature would complement the existing fallback mechanism (error recovery) with intelligent proactive routing (cost/capability optimization).
