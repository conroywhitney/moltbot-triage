## Description

## Summary

The output of `clawdbot logs` currently displays timestamps in UTC, regardless of the system's local timezone settings. For users in non-UTC regions (e.g., JST), this creates unnecessary friction when correlating log events with local system events or manual observations.

## Proposed solution

I propose adding support for local/custom timezones in log timestamps. Specifically, I suggest the following implementation priority:

1. Auto-detection: Automatically use the system's local timezone by default.
2. Configuration: Add a config option (e.g., `logging.timezone: "local"` or `"Asia/Tokyo"`).
3. CLI Flag: Provide a `--local-time` flag for `clawdbot logs` to override settings on the fly.

## Alternatives considered

- Manual conversion: Converting UTC to local time mentally is error-prone and tedious.
- External tools: Piping logs to `awk` or date-conversion scripts adds unnecessary complexity to a standard workflow.

## Additional context

- Logger: Clawdbot utilizes tslog.
- Current Behavior: Timestamps are hardcoded or defaulted to UTC (e.g., `2026-02-03 01:45:23.456Z`).
- Tested Environment:
  - System TZ: JST (UTC+9)
  - Version: 2026.1.24-3
  - Observed logs remained in UTC despite the system setting.

### Analysis of the current code

In `src/logging/logger.ts`, the custom transport uses `toISOString()` which explicitly converts the date to UTC:

```typescript
const time = logObj.date?.toISOString?.() ?? new Date().toISOString();
```

To support local time, this should be replaced with a formatter that respects the system's timezone offset.
