## Description

Related to PR #671

When running multiple gateways (enabled by PR #671), the internal browser tool fails:

\`\`\`
500: {"error":"Error: Failed to start Chrome CDP on port 18800 for profile \"clawd\"."}
\`\`\`

### Root Cause

- Browser CDP port 18800 is derived from control port 18791 + 9
- Hardcoded in \`src/config/port-defaults.ts\`
- Multiple gateways cause port conflicts

### Suggested Fixes

1. Make CDP port configurable per profile in \`clawdbot.json\`
2. Add port conflict detection and auto-recovery
3. Document multi-gateway browser usage
