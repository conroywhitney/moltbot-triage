## Description

## Use Case

Telegram Business allows Premium users to connect a bot to their personal chats. The bot can:
- Read messages sent TO the user (not to the bot directly)
- Respond on behalf of the user
- Manage multiple personal conversations

## Current Behavior

ClawdBot receives `business_message` updates but silently ignores them:

```log
[telegram] update: {"business_message":{"business_connection_id":"nCwW...","from":{"first_name":"..."},"text":"..."}}
```

No `telegram inbound:` processing occurs — messages are dropped.

## Expected Behavior

1. **Process `business_message`** same as regular `message`
2. **Store inbox history** for queries like "who wrote today?"
3. **Support reply modes** per chat:
   - `monitor` — read only (default)
   - `manual` — wait for explicit reply command
   - `auto` — respond automatically on behalf of user
4. **Configuration**: `channels.telegram.businessPolicy` (open/allowlist/disabled)
5. **Natural language commands**:
   - "Who wrote me today?"
   - "Reply to Lily that I'll be home in an hour"
   - "Enable auto-replies for chat with Lily"
