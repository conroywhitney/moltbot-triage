## Description

## Problem Description

Currently, when a SubAgent task completes, its results are injected into the main session conversation as a `role: "user"` message. In the WebUI, this makes it appear as if the user themselves sent the SubAgent's raw output, which is confusing.

## Current Behavior

1. User assigns task to MasterAgent
2. MasterAgent spawns SubAgent via `sessions_spawn`
3. SubAgent completes task and returns findings
4. System injects findings as a **user message** in the main session
5. In WebUI, it looks like the user sent the SubAgent output themselves

## Expected Behavior

SubAgent results should display as **Tool Output** (similar to how Tool Call results are shown):
- Distinct visual styling from user messages
- Collapsible/expandable format
- Clear indication that this is SubAgent output, not user input

## Benefits

1. Clearer distinction between user input and SubAgent output
2. Cleaner conversation flow
3. More intuitive AI assistant interaction pattern
4. Consistent with how Tool Call outputs are displayed

## Suggested Implementation

Render SubAgent results as a special system-level Tool Output block, styled similarly to existing Tool Call outputs (gray background, distinct from user/assistant messages).
