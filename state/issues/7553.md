## Description

The gateway crashes multiple times per day due to unhandled promise rejections from failed network requests.

### Error
[clawdbot] Unhandled promise rejection: TypeError: fetch failed
at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:16416:13
at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:104:5)

Also seeing:
- `AbortError: This operation was aborted`
- `GrammyError: Call to 'sendMessage' failed! (502: Bad Gateway)`

### Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Node.js version:** 25.5.0
- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 24.6.0 arm64)
- **Channels:** Telegram enabled

### Frequency
3-6+ crashes per day observed over several days.

### Behavior
1. Gateway is running normally
2. Network request (likely Telegram polling or API call) fails
3. Error is not caught
4. Unhandled promise rejection → process exit
5. launchd restarts the process (due to `KeepAlive`)

### Impact
- Brief service interruptions (~1-2 seconds per crash)
- Any in-progress operations are lost
- User confusion when responses suddenly stop

### Expected Behavior
Network failures should be caught and handled gracefully:
- Retry logic with backoff
- Log the failure without crashing
- Graceful degradation if a service is unreachable

### Workaround
launchd's `KeepAlive: true` auto-restarts, but crashes are disruptive.

### Labels
bug, stability
