## Description

## Summary

When an agent sends a long command via the exec tool, the approval dialog in WebChat becomes unusable — the Approve/Deny buttons are pushed off-screen or hidden behind the command text. The user cannot approve or deny the execution without resizing the browser window or using keyboard shortcuts (if any exist).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Agent sends an exec command with a long command string (>200 chars), e.g.:
   ```
   powershell -Command "Get-ChildItem 'C:\Users\ukr\AppData\Local' -Directory | ForEach-Object { $size = (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum; Write-Host ('{0}: {1} MB' -f $_.Name, [math]::Round($size/1MB)) }"
   ```
2. WebChat shows the approval dialog
3. **The Approve/Deny buttons are not visible** — user must scroll or resize to find them

## Expected Behavior

- Command text should be truncated or scrollable within a fixed-height container
- Approve/Deny buttons should always be visible and accessible
- Optionally: "Show full command" expand toggle for long commands

## Impact

- **Blocks agent workflow** — agent waits indefinitely for approval that user can't give
- **Frustrating UX** — user knows the agent is waiting but can't interact
- Power users with complex commands hit this frequently
- Mobile browsers are especially affected

## Proposed Fix

```
┌─ Exec Approval ────────────────────────┐
│                                        │
│ powershell -Command "Get-ChildItem     │
│ 'C:\Users\ukr\AppData\Local'..."       │
│                          [Show full ▼] │
│                                        │
│              [Deny]  [Approve ✓]       │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Fixed-height command area (max 3-4 lines) with scroll/expand
- Buttons pinned to bottom of dialog, always visible
- Optional: keyboard shortcut (Enter = approve, Esc = deny)

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.1.30, Windows 10, Chrome & Edge
- WebChat primary interface
- Both desktop and mobile affected
