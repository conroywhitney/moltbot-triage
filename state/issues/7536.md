## Description

Hey,

I noticed that when I upload multiple files in a single Slack message, only the first one gets through to the agent. The others are just silently dropped.

**What happens:**
- Upload 3 PDFs in one message
- Agent only sees the first one
- No error, no warning

**Where it comes from:**

Looking at `dist/slack/monitor/media.js`, the `resolveSlackMedia()` function loops through `files[]` but returns immediately after the first successful download:

```js
for (const file of files) {
    // ... download logic ...
    return { path, contentType, placeholder };  // exits here
}
```

So Slack sends all files correctly, OpenClaw receives them, but only processes the first.

**Suggested fix:**

Return an array instead of a single object, and update the caller in `prepare.js` to handle multiple attachments.

Happy to help with a PR if this is something you'd want to fix. Let me know!
