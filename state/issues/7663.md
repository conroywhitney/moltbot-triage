## Description

**Environment**

- OpenClaw version: `2026.1.30 (76b5208)`
- OS: Windows 10
- Gateway: Scheduled Task, loopback only
- Slack config (redacted):

```jsonc
"channels": {
  "slack": {
    "mode": "socket",
    "webhookPath": "/slack/events",
    "enabled": true,
    "botToken": "xoxb-…",
    "appToken": "xapp-1-…",
    "userTokenReadOnly": true,
    "groupPolicy": "open"
  }
}
```

**Observed behavior**

- Slack DMs from me to the bot arrive correctly (I can see them in the OpenClaw web UI with `channel: slack`, `channelId: D0AC90A8S7Q`, and a `slack message id`).
- The embedded/main agent responds, but its replies do **not** show up in Slack.
- If I explicitly send via the Slack bridge (using the `message` tool with `channel: "slack"` and `target: "D0AC90A8S7Q"`), the message appears in the Slack DM as expected.
-  Gateway is healthy:
  - `Runtime: running`
  - `RPC probe: ok`
  - `Listening: 127.0.0.1:18789`

So inbound Slack → OpenClaw works, but outbound OpenClaw → Slack does *not* work for the embedded/main agent’s default replies.

**What seems to be happening**

-  The embedded/main session created for this Slack DM is **not** being tagged with a Slack `sourceChannel` / `sourceTarget` in the gateway/session metadata.
-  The normal reply path for this agent goes only to the local/web session.
-  The Slack reply path in `dist/slack/monitor/replies.js` (`deliverReplies`) only gets used when explicitly invoked via the Slack send path, not for these embedded replies.

In other words: Slack DMs are not treated as first-class origins for the embedded/main agent’s session, so its answers never get routed back to Slack unless I manually call the Slack channel plugin.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Configure Slack in `openclaw.json` in socket mode as above.
2. Start the gateway:

   ```powershell
   openclaw gateway start
   openclaw gateway status
