## Description

## Summary

Users should be able to abort/cancel an in-progress agent response via messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Signal, etc.) by sending a `/stop` or `/cancel` command.

## Motivation

Currently, there is no way to interrupt the agent mid-response when using messaging channels:

- **Webchat**: Has a stop button (though [#1906](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/1906) reports it's not visible)
- **TUI**: Has Escape key (though [#1296](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/1296) reports race condition issues)
- **Messaging channels**: No mechanism at all

This is problematic when:
1. The agent starts going down the wrong path (wrong tool, wrong approach)
2. The agent gets stuck in a loop or lengthy operation
3. The user realizes the request was wrong and wants to course-correct
4. Runaway tool calls are consuming resources/API credits

## Proposed Solution

Add support for a `/stop` or `/cancel` slash command (or both) that:
1. Aborts the current active run for the session
2. Works across all messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Signal, Slack, etc.)
3. Sends a confirmation message like "Generation stopped" or "Aborted"

The backend already supports `chat.abort` by `sessionKey` alone (without `runId`), so this should be straightforward to implement at the channel handler level.

## Alternatives Considered

- **React with ❌ emoji**: Could work for platforms that support reactions, but not universal
- **Keyword detection**: Risky, might trigger false positives mid-conversation

## Additional Context

Related issues:
- #1906 - Stop button not visible in webchat
- #1296 - TUI Escape/abort race condition

This would complete the "abort" story across all surfaces.
