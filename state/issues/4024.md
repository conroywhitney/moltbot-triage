## Description

## Summary
Enable Clawdbot to recall knowledge from a Milvus-based vector database, allowing it to answer questions using existing documents instead of relying only on model context.

## Proposed solution
Add a Milvus knowledge base tool that:
- Embeds user queries
- Retrieves top-K relevant documents from Milvus
- Returns structured results for RAG-style response generation

## Alternatives considered
- Prompt-only context (does not scale)
- Keyword search in relational databases (poor semantic recall)
- Local FAISS indexes (limited persistence and scalability)

## Additional context
This will serve as a core capability for RAG and enterprise knowledge assistant scenarios.
