## Description

When creating reminders via WhatsApp, the agent generates Unix timestamps that are ~3 years in the past (2023 instead of 2026).

Environment:
•  OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
•  OS: macOS
•  Model: openai/gpt-4o-mini

Steps to reproduce:
1. Ask the bot via WhatsApp: "Remind me in 3 minutes to do X"
2. Check ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json

Expected: atMs timestamp should be current time + 3 minutes (e.g., 1738444800000 for Feb 2026)

Actual: atMs is set to 2023 timestamp (e.g., 1675270849625)

Impact: All scheduled reminders fail because they're immediately "in the past"
