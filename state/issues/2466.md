## Description

## Feature Request
Add a floating "scroll to bottom" button in the webchat that appears when the user has scrolled up from the bottom of the conversation.

## Motivation
- Common chat UX pattern
- Easy way to return to latest messages after reading history
- Visual indicator that there's more content below

## Implementation
- Small circular button with down chevron icon
- Appears at bottom-center when `!isPinnedToBottom`
- Semi-transparent with `.ultraThinMaterial` background
- Animates scroll to bottom on tap
- Fade+scale transition when appearing/disappearing

## Files affected
- `apps/shared/ClawdbotKit/Sources/ClawdbotChatUI/ChatView.swift`
