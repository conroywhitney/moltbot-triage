## Description

## Problem
The system prompt includes timezone but not the day of the week. This leads to agents making incorrect assumptions about what day it is (e.g., saying 'today is Saturday' when it's actually Sunday).

## Proposed Solution
Add the day of week to the 'Current Date & Time' section in the system prompt:

```
Time zone: Europe/Amsterdam
Day: Sunday
```

Or even better, include the full date:
```
Current date: Sunday, 25 January 2026
Time zone: Europe/Amsterdam
```

## Why This Matters
- Scheduling and reminders depend on knowing the correct day
- Weekly recurring tasks (like 'Sunday reflection questions') get triggered on wrong days
- Agents confidently state incorrect day information to users

## Current Workaround
Running `date` command before making any day-of-week claims, but this is error-prone as it requires remembering to do so.

## Comments

### @conroywhitney (2026-01-29)

Linking #3658 as a better solution path — instead of adding the date back to the system prompt (which breaks the cache optimization from `66eec295b`), the gateway would inject timestamps into TUI/web messages, matching the existing pattern for channel plugins.

Combined with a `session_status` hint in the prompt for mid-conversation time needs, this solves the day-of-week problem without reverting the perf work.
