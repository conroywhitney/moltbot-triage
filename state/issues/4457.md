## Description

## Summary
Openclaw currently supports integrations like WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack (etc.), but there is no native Viber channel. For teams in Bulgaria and other markets where Viber is a primary customer communication channel, this blocks adoption or forces running a parallel workflow outside of Openclaw.

## Proposed solution
Add a first-class Viber integration/channel to Openclaw (and therefore Clawdbot) so it can:
- Send outbound messages (text + optionally media/attachments) to a user or conversation.
- Receive inbound messages via Viber webhooks and route them into the same Openclaw message pipeline as other channels.
- Support conversation identity mapping:
  - Map Viber user IDs / conversation IDs to Openclaw users/threads.
  - Store channel metadata needed for replies (sender id, message id, timestamps).
- Provide basic operational controls:
  - Configure Viber Bot token/credentials in environment variables or config.
  - Health checks and clear logging for webhook verification and message delivery failures.
- (Nice to have, if feasible) Support rich message types (buttons/keyboard) that Viber supports, with graceful degradation to plain text where needed.

Implementation sketch (high-level):
- New `viber` provider module similar to existing channel providers.
- Webhook endpoint handler that validates incoming payloads and normalizes events into Openclaw’s internal message schema.
- Outbound adapter that converts Openclaw messages into Viber API calls.
- Minimal docs: setup steps, required env vars, local testing notes.

## Alternatives considered
- Using a generic HTTP webhook bridge: run an external relay service that converts Viber events into an existing Openclaw-supported channel format. This adds operational overhead, latency, and makes debugging harder.
- Using a third-party omni-channel provider (e.g., a gateway that abstracts Viber): likely adds cost, limits features, and introduces vendor dependency.
- Asking users to move to Telegram/WhatsApp: not realistic for markets where Viber is the default.

## Additional context
- Viber is heavily used in Bulgaria and parts of Eastern Europe for customer comms.
