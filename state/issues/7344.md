## Description

## Summary

Add Tavily as a native `web_search` provider alongside Brave and Perplexity.

## Motivation

Currently, `tools.web.search` only supports:
- **Brave Search** (default)
- **Perplexity** (via OpenRouter or direct API)

Tavily is a popular AI-optimized search API specifically designed for AI agents and RAG applications. It offers:
- 1000 free searches/month (generous free tier)
- AI-synthesized answers with citations
- Content extraction optimized for LLMs
- No cryptocurrency company affiliation (unlike Brave)

Many users prefer Tavily over Brave for philosophical or practical reasons.

## Proposed Solution

Add `tavily` as a native provider option:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    web: {
      search: {
        provider: "tavily",  // New option
        tavily: {
          apiKey: "tvly-xxx",
          searchDepth: "basic",  // or "advanced"
          maxResults: 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or via environment variable: `TAVILY_API_KEY`

## Current Workarounds

1. **Custom Skill**: Create a skill that calls Tavily API via `exec` + `curl`
2. **MCP Integration**: The docs mention `openclaw mcp add tavily`, but this command doesn't exist in the Docker version (CLI returns "unknown command 'mcp'")

Both workarounds are suboptimal compared to native integration.

Hi~ I addressed this issue in PR #7370

If you have some time, I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look.
