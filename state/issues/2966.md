## Description

## Description

When a PDF document is sent via WhatsApp, the message notification arrives but the file is not saved to the media/inbound/ folder.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Send a PDF document via WhatsApp to the bot
2. Message shows <media:document> but no file path is included
3. Check media/inbound/ folder - no PDF file present

## Expected Behavior

PDF should be saved to media/inbound/ with a UUID filename, and the message should include the file path like images do:
\\\
[media attached: C:\...\.clawdbot\media\inbound\xxx.pdf (application/pdf)]
\\\

## Actual Behavior

- Message only shows: \<media:document>\
- No file path provided
- PDF file not saved to inbound folder

## Evidence

- Images (.jpg) work correctly ✅
- Audio (.ogg) work correctly ✅  
- PDFs do NOT work ❌

A PDF from 26/01/2026 was received correctly (5.8MB), but multiple PDFs sent on 27/01/2026 were not saved.

## Environment

- OS: Windows 11
- Node: v24.6.0
- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: WhatsApp
- Config mediaMaxMb: 50

## Workaround

Currently asking users to send documents as photos/images instead of PDFs (loses quality).
