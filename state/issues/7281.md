## Description

## Summary

When a hook mapping has `deliver: true` and the primary channel is unavailable (e.g., WhatsApp disconnected), there's no way to specify an alternative delivery channel. The delivery silently fails and "(error)" is appended to the hook name in session summaries.

## Proposed Solution

Add a `fallbackChannel` (or `fallbackChannels` array) option to hook mappings:

```json5
{
  hooks: {
    mappings: [
      {
        match: { path: "gmail" },
        action: "agent",
        name: "Gmail",
        deliver: true,
        channel: "whatsapp",
        to: "+15551234567",
        fallbackChannel: "webchat"  // <- new option
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When WhatsApp delivery fails, it would automatically try webchat (or other specified fallback).

## Current Behavior

- Hook runs successfully
- Agent response generated
- WhatsApp delivery attempted → fails (channel disconnected)
- "(error)" appended to hook name in main session summary
- No notification reaches user

## Expected Behavior

- Hook runs successfully  
- Agent response generated
- WhatsApp delivery attempted → fails
- Fallback to webchat (or next in chain)
- User receives notification on available channel
- Clean hook name without "(error)" suffix

## Use Case

Gmail notifications via hooks. Primary delivery to WhatsApp, but when WhatsApp is temporarily disconnected (phone restarting, network issues), notifications should fall back to webchat so the user doesn't miss important emails.

## Additional Context

The `channel` option already defaults to `last` which "falls back to WhatsApp" per the docs, but there's no configurable fallback chain when the specified channel is unavailable.
