## Description

## Summary
Given the fast pace of project development it would really simplify life for LLMs to have a single llms.txt file to point them for asking questions. Because currently one should either scan the repo, or walk thought various docs pages

## Proposed solution
Add at building step a script to merge all docs into a single file

## Alternatives considered
Keep everything as is
