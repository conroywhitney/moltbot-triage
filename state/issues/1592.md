## Description

## Feature Description
Add support for Telegram WebApp buttons (Mini Apps) that open an embedded browser within Telegram.

## Use Cases
- Open dashboards, task viewers, or custom UIs directly from the bot
- View beads issues via web interface without leaving Telegram
- Display rich interactive content (charts, forms, etc.)

## Proposed Implementation
Add a `webAppUrl` option to inline buttons in the message tool:

```yaml
buttons:
  - text: "Open Dashboard"
    webAppUrl: "https://example.com/dashboard"
```

Or via config for a persistent menu button:

```yaml
telegram:
  webAppButton:
    text: "Tasks"
    url: "https://my-tailscale-host:9443/"
```

## Telegram API Reference
- [WebApp Buttons](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#implementing-mini-apps)
- [KeyboardButtonWebApp](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#keyboardbuttonwebapp)
- [InlineKeyboardButtonWebApp](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton) (web_app field)

## Notes
- WebApp URL must be HTTPS
- Works great with Tailscale Funnel or internal tailnet URLs
- Could integrate with existing Canvas feature for richer interactions

**RFC**

Telegram lets users join a voice call and open a Mini App at the same time. This means a Mini App can work as a simple in-call A2UI

For Moltbot, this could be used to run agents inside group calls:
- A group call is the main session
- Each subgroup represents one agent (developer, manager, researcher, doctor etc)
- The bot with a Mini App is added to the group
- The Mini App can be opened from the group to interact with that agent during the call
- In each subgroup bot can pin a message with action button to open a mini app with callback context
