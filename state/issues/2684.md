## Description

## Feature Request

**Summary:**
The text input box in the Control UI chat interface should automatically adjust its height based on content, similar to modern chat apps.

**Current Behavior:**
- Input box has a fixed height
- When typing longer messages, the content scrolls instead of expanding vertically

**Desired Behavior:**
- Input box should grow vertically as the user types more text (up to a reasonable max height)
- Auto-shrink when text is deleted
- Provide a better user experience for longer messages

**Why:**
- Better matches modern chat UX patterns
- Improves readability when composing longer messages
- Reduces need to scroll within the input area

**Environment:**
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: macOS 26.2 (arm64)
- Browser: [fill in your browser]
