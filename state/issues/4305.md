## Description

## Summary
Users want to give Moltbots their own email addresses. AgentMail is a free agent-native solution for this.

## Proposed solution
Adds a new channel extension for [AgentMail](https://agentmail.to/) - a free email inbox API designed for AI agents.

Real-time inbound via WebSockets: Uses AgentMail's WebSocket API for instant message delivery with automatic reconnection and resubscription on disconnect
Outbound via replyAll: Replies include all original recipients (To/Cc) for proper email threading
Onboarding flow: Prompts for API token, allows selecting an existing inbox or creating a new one, and configures allowFrom filtering
Core channel integration: Registered in channel dock and registry (appears after Discord in channel selection)
Sender filtering: Uses existing allowFrom semantics (empty = allow all senders); labels allowed messages with "allowed" tag

## Alternatives considered
Another option is Gmail, although we can implement both. The issue is the Google is banning accounts created for Moltbot and connecting one's personal Gmail is a huge security risk.
