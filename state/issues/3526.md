## Description

## Bug Description

Clawdbot's Slack integration is intercepting DM messages that are not directed at Clawdbot.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure Clawdbot with Slack integration
2. Have a DM conversation with another human user (not Clawdbot)
3. Clawdbot receives and responds to messages in that DM channel

## Expected Behavior

Clawdbot should only receive/respond to messages in:
- Channels explicitly configured for Clawdbot
- DMs where the user is talking directly to Clawdbot (e.g., the Clawdbot app DM)

Clawdbot should NOT intercept DMs between two human users.

## Actual Behavior

Messages in a DM between two humans (User A and User B) are being routed to Clawdbot, causing it to respond to conversations it's not part of.

## Impact

- Privacy concern: Clawdbot sees private conversations
- UX issue: Clawdbot responds inappropriately to messages not meant for it
- Confusion: Users don't understand why Clawdbot is responding

## Environment

- Channel: Slack
- Runtime: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0, arm64)
