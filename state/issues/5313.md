## Description

## Summary
The cron subsystem becomes unresponsive when multiple one-shot (`schedule.kind: "at"`) jobs pile up past their scheduled time. All cron API calls (status, list, add, remove) time out indefinitely, while other gateway operations continue to work normally.

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- OS: Linux 6.17.0-12-generic (x64)
- Node: v22.22.0
- Gateway mode: local

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create multiple one-shot cron jobs with `schedule.kind: "at"`
2. Let them become overdue (past their `atMs` timestamp)
3. Attempt any cron operation (e.g., `openclaw cron list` or cron tool `action: status`)

## Expected Behavior
Cron API calls should return promptly, even if jobs are overdue. Overdue one-shot jobs should either execute or be marked as missed/skipped.

## Actual Behavior
- All cron API calls hang until timeout (10+ seconds)
- CLI commands (`openclaw cron status`, `openclaw cron list`) also hang
- Gateway shows CPU spike (~67%) suggesting busy loop or retry storm
- Other gateway operations work fine (e.g., `gateway config.get`, `sessions_list`)

## Evidence from jobs.json
```json
{
  "id": "dd5a9a83-8a88-4c34-ab02-f16b9d0c7288",
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule": { "kind": "at", "atMs": 1769848080000 },
  "state": {
    "nextRunAtMs": 1769848080000,
    "lastError": "empty-heartbeat-file",
    "lastStatus": "skipped"
  }
}
```
11 jobs were in this state, most enabled with past-due `atMs` times.

## Workaround
1. Stop gateway
2. Clear or backup `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`
3. Replace with `{"version":1,"jobs":[]}`
4. Restart gateway

After clearing the overdue jobs, cron works perfectly again.

## Suggested Fix
- Add timeout/circuit breaker for overdue job processing
- Auto-disable or mark as "missed" one-shot jobs that are significantly overdue
- Ensure cron API handlers remain responsive even during job processing
