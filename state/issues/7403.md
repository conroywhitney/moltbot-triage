## Description

## Summary

Add a **Private Mode** toggle in Mission Control that suppresses all workspace context, allowing users to use OpenClaw for demos, content creation, and public-facing work without exposing personal data or modifying their workspace.

## Use Case

Users creating content, running demos, or sharing their screen need to use OpenClaw without:
- Leaking personal context (memory files, user info, custom persona)
- Accidentally modifying their real workspace files
- Exposing private information stored in workspace

## Proposed Behavior

When **Private Mode is ON**:
- Suppress all workspace file injection: `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/*`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`
- Agent acts as stock Clawd — no persona, no user context, no history
- Session gets a **temporary scratchpad** for working memory (wiped when private mode ends or session closes)
- Existing workspace files remain **untouched** — no reads, no writes

When **Private Mode is OFF**:
- Resume normal operation with full workspace context

## UI

- Toggle switch in Mission Control
- Visual indicator when active (e.g., 🔒 icon or "Private" badge in session header)

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Gateway** — Flag to suppress workspace file injection at session start
2. **Session state** — Isolated temp memory that doesn't persist to disk
3. **Mission Control UI** — Toggle component + visual indicator
