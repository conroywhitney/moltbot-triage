## Description

Hi, I am opening a new issue for this request since the previous one #1117 was closed automatically. I really need the ability to configure multiple accounts from the same provider, specifically for OpenAI. This is important for separating token usage and managing costs across different broadcast groups. Thanks for considering this!
