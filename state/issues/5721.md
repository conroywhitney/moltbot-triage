## Description

## Description

When using the macOS Companion App in **Remote over SSH** mode (via Tailscale), the Companion App UI indicates an active connection to the Gateway, but the Gateway itself reports the node as `connected: false`.

This means features that depend on node connectivity (canvas push, notifications, camera, screen, etc.) do not work despite the app appearing connected.

## Environment

- **Companion App**: macOS, version 2026.1.30 (8469)
- **Gateway**: Linux (x86_64), OpenClaw 2026.1.29
- **Connection**: Remote over SSH via Tailscale MagicDNS hostname
- **Gateway config**: bind=loopback, tailscale.mode=serve

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run OpenClaw Gateway on a Linux host
2. On a Mac, open the Companion App → General → set to **Remote over SSH**
3. Enter the SSH connection string (Tailscale hostname)
4. App appears to connect and shows as active
5. On the Gateway side, check node status — node shows `paired: true, connected: false`
6. Attempting to push a canvas to the node fails with `node not connected`

## Observed Behavior

```
Node status from Gateway:
  displayName: "MacBook Pro"
  platform: "macOS 26.1.0"
  paired: true
  connected: false    <-- should be true
  caps: []            <-- empty, no capabilities registered
  commands: []
```

The Companion App UI shows the connection as active. The Gateway receives the node pairing but the WebSocket/control channel for the node never fully registers as connected.

Note: `caps` and `commands` are both empty arrays, suggesting the node handshake never completes to the capability exchange phase.

## Expected Behavior

When the Companion App shows as connected, the Gateway should also report the node as `connected: true` with capabilities populated (camera, screen, exec, etc.).

## Possibly Related

- #5710 — The initial connection attempt showed a `client/id` schema validation error. Upgrading the app resolved the error message, but the node connection state issue may be a remaining symptom of the same underlying protocol mismatch over SSH tunnels.
