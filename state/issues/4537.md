## Description

## Bug Description
When sending to a Signal group via the message tool, the base64-encoded group ID is lowercased before being passed to signal-cli. This breaks the ID since base64 is case-sensitive.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Get any Signal group ID (base64 format with mixed case)
2. Try to send via message tool:

message action=send channel=signal target=signal:group:<BASE64_GROUP_ID> message="Test"

3. Error shows the group ID in all lowercase

## Expected Behavior
Group ID should be passed to signal-cli unchanged (preserve case).

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- signal-cli version: 0.13.23

🔗 **Related:** PR #4568 addresses this — it preserves group ID case (fixes base64 being lowercased) along with Windows npm ENOENT.
