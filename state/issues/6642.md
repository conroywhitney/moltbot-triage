## Description

## Bug

In the Control UI dashboard (webchat at `127.0.0.1:18789`), the header area has two issues:

1. **Overlapping text** — "OpenClaw" text renders on top of "GATEWAY DASHBOARD" subtitle
2. **Broken image icon** — The logo/avatar image next to the header fails to load (shows broken image placeholder)

## Screenshot

The "OpenClaw" label and "GATEWAY DASHBOARD" text overlap each other in the top-left header area. A broken image icon appears to the left of the text.

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.1.30 (npm install)
- macOS 26.2 (arm64)
- Safari / Chrome
- Gateway running locally on `127.0.0.1:18789`

## Expected

- Logo image loads correctly
- Header text and subtitle are properly spaced without overlap
