## Description

## Summary

Following the [CLAWDINATOR guidance](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6171#issuecomment-3831047989) to open an issue first before submitting security-related PRs. This proposal bundles 4 complementary security hardening improvements that reduce supply-chain and runtime risks.

## Motivation

OpenClaw has 500k+ lines of code across multiple platforms with browser automation, command execution, and WebSocket control plane. While the project already has excellent security foundations (`detect-secrets`, `openclaw security audit`, loopback-by-default), there are baseline gaps that could be closed with minimal risk:

1. **Remote asset dependency** (Control UI loads SVG from external CDN)
2. **Missing HTTP security headers** (no baseline CSP/XFO/nosniff on gateway responses)
3. **Unused security tooling configs** (actionlint + zizmor configs exist but aren't enforced in CI)
4. **No dependency vulnerability scanning** (no CodeQL or dependency-review in CI)

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1: Supply Chain Hardening (docs + CI)

**1. Localize Control UI logo asset** (addresses #5170)
- Replace hardcoded `mintcdn.com` SVG URL with bundled local asset
- PR reference: [#6166](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6166) (closed), [#6161](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6161) (alternative implementation)
- Risk reduced: Removes external CDN dependency that could be compromised

**2. Wire up existing CI security configs**
- Add `.github/workflows/actionlint.yml` (uses existing `.github/actionlint.yaml`)
- Add `.github/workflows/zizmor.yml` (uses existing `zizmor.yml`)
- PR reference: [#6194](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6194) (closed, CI was fixed)
- Risk reduced: Catches workflow security footguns and misconfigurations

### Phase 2: Runtime + Dependency Hardening

**3. Add baseline HTTP security headers**
- Add conservative headers to gateway HTTP responses: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Permissions-Policy`
- Intentionally scoped to be safe for both Control UI and API routes
- PR reference: [#6171](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6171) (closed, had review feedback incorporated)
- Risk reduced: Reduces clickjacking, content-sniffing, and feature abuse surface

**4. Add dependency scanning**
- Add `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` (GitHub official action)
- Add `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (JavaScript/TypeScript analysis)
- PR reference: [#6195](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6195) (closed, CI was green)
- Risk reduced: Catches vulnerable dependencies and common insecure code patterns

## Implementation Notes

- **All changes are additive** - no breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Minimal permissions** - CI workflows use `contents: read` only (CodeQL needs `security-events: write`)
- **Follows existing patterns** - Uses same action versions and config styles as current CI
- **Tested** - All PRs were validated with `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, and targeted tests

## Request for Maintainers

@steipete (or active maintainers) - would you be open to these 4 hardening PRs? If yes, I can:
1. Re-open each PR individually with reference to this issue
2. Or combine into a single "security hardening bundle" PR if preferred
3. Or adjust scope based on your feedback

The goal is to reduce "death by a thousand cuts" security risks while keeping the PRs small and reviewable.
