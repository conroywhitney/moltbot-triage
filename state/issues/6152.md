## Description

## Bug Report: Skills detection fails on Windows even when binaries are in PATH (bundled skills: github, weather, etc.)

### Environment
- **OS:** Windows 11 (10.0.26200)
- **OpenClaw:** 2026.1.30
- **Node Manager:** fnm (v24.13.0)
- **Shell:** PowerShell / cmd

### Description
On Windows, several bundled skills (e.g., `github`, `weather`) are flagged as `✗ missing` in `openclaw skills list` or `openclaw skills check`, despite the required binaries (`gh`, `curl`) being installed and correctly listed in the system/user `PATH`.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) and verify it works in terminal (`gh --version`).
2. Run `openclaw skills list`.
3. Observed: `github` skill is marked as `✗ missing`.
4. Run `where.exe gh` -> returns valid path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`).

### Root Cause Analysis
The skill detection logic (likely using `requires: { bins: ["gh"] }`) fails to locate binaries when OpenClaw is running as a background service (Gateway) or within a Node version manager environment like `fnm`. 

The Gateway service (Windows Scheduled Task) often inherits a limited `PATH` that lacks the dynamic paths injected by `fnm` or standard Windows installer paths that haven't propagated to the task runner's environment.

### Workaround (Manual)
I had to manually edit the `SKILL.md` files in the global `node_modules` directory to remove the `requires` check to force the skill to `✓ ready`.

### Suggested Fixes
1. **Manual Overrides**: Allow users to specify absolute binary paths in `openclaw.json` (e.g., `skills.entries.github.binPath`).
2. **Improved Detection**: On Windows, if a simple `PATH` lookup fails, use `where.exe` or check common installation directories.
3. **Doctor Warning**: `openclaw doctor` should explicitly check if required skill binaries are missing from the *Gateway's* environment specifically, and offer to fix/path-append them.
