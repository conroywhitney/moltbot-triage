## Description

## Summary
Add an option to send a customizable **placeholder message** (e.g., "🧠 Thinking...") immediately when a message is received, then **delete it** when the actual response is ready.

## Current Behavior
- Telegram shows "typing..." indicator while processing
- Draft streaming (`streamMode: "partial"`) shows real-time text generation
- No option for a custom loading message that gets replaced

## Proposed Behavior
```
1. User sends message
2. Bot immediately sends: "🧠 Analyzing..." (customizable)
3. Agent processes and generates response
4. Bot deletes the placeholder message
5. Bot sends the actual response
```

## Why This Matters
- **Better UX**: Users know the bot received their message and is working
- **Personality**: Custom loading messages add character (e.g., "Jarvis thinking...", "Brewing coffee...")
- **Transparency**: Shows progress for long-running tasks

## Suggested Config
```json5
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "placeholderMessage": {
        "enabled": true,
        "messages": [
          "🧠 Thinking...",
          "💭 Processing...",
          "⚡ Working on it..."
        ],
        "deleteOnResponse": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Ideas
1. Add `message:received` hook event (currently listed as "Future Events" in hooks.md)
2. Send placeholder via Telegram API on message receive
3. Store message_id for deletion
4. Delete placeholder when response is ready

## Related
- Hooks system already supports event-driven automation
- `message:received` and `message:sent` are planned as "Future Events"
- Telegram API supports message deletion

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Telegram
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)

Hi! I’d like to work on this feature and implement customizable placeholder messages for Telegram. Could you assign this issue to me?

### @lucasmpramos (2026-01-29)

this is a must have for channels. when the agent is working or thinking, can feel like things are stale on whtaspp or connection was lost, causing us to have to bump the model to check for status - thus possibly breaking / interrupting the "thinking/working" 

### @RusilKoirala (2026-01-29)

I’d like to help with this.
I can start by implementing the Telegram placeholder message part (send + delete),
and follow existing patterns. Happy to adjust based on feedback.
