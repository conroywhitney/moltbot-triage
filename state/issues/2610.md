## Description

## Summary
No endpoint customization entry in the gateway web UI.
It looks like hard to change specific LLM endpoint, modify the configure file is the only way, while I still cannot solve this problem.

## Proposed solution
Need an entry to change the LLM endpoint, eg: change it on gateway web UI.
