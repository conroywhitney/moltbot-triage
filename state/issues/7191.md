## Description

## Feature Request

**What:** Add configurable color theming for the webchat/Control UI.

**Why:** The current UI uses hardcoded CSS variables. Users who want brighter text in dark mode or more vibrant colors in light mode have no built-in way to customize this — they need browser extensions like Stylus to inject custom CSS.

**Proposed solution:**

Add a `gateway.controlUi.theme` config section, e.g.:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    controlUi: {
      theme: {
        dark: {
          text: "#f5f5f5",
          textStrong: "#ffffff",
          chatText: "#f5f5f5",
          muted: "#b0b0b0",
          accent: "#ff5c5c"
        },
        light: {
          text: "#111111",
          textStrong: "#000000",
          chatText: "#111111",
          accent: "#dc2626"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or alternatively, support injecting a custom CSS file/snippet.

**Workaround:** Currently using the Stylus browser extension to override CSS variables.
