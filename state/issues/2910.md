## Description

## Summary
Implement a pluggable knowledge‑graph memory layer for Clawdbot, using providers like OpenMemory, Cognee, or ZEP to persist and query long‑term, structured user/context data across sessions and channels. The goal is to add an explicit graph of entities, relationships, and events that Clawdbot can reason over, inspect, and evolve over time. Add temporal memory, recall structured facts, not just chat history.

## Proposed solution
Introduce a small MemoryGraph interface and plug in providers like OpenMemory, Cognee, or ZEP. Extract entities/relations from events and query the graph before each task.
Define a MemoryGraph interface (or similar) that supports core operations:
upsert_entities(nodes, properties)
upsert_relations(edges, properties)
query(patterns, filters, time ranges)
summarize(subgraph, for_task)

Implement adapters for at least one of: OpenMemory, Cognee, ZEP. Each adapter maps the MemoryGraph interface to the provider’s API (auth, schema, query language, limits).

## Alternatives considered
MCP Memory adds extra steps, which are much less efficient.
