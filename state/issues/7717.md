## Description

## Feature Request

**Description:**
Add support for Discord role mentions (e.g., `@bots`, `@AI`) to trigger bot responses, not just direct @mentions.

**Current Behavior:**
- Direct `@BotName` mentions → bot wakes up and responds ✅
- Role mentions (`@RoleName` where bot has that role) → bot sees the message but doesn't wake up to respond ❌

**Desired Behavior:**
A config option like `triggerOnRoles` that accepts an array of role IDs:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "guilds": {
        "<guild_id>": {
          "triggerOnRoles": ["<role_id_1>", "<role_id_2>"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Case:**
Running multiple Clawdbot instances in the same Discord server. A shared `@AI` role allows users to ping all bots at once for collaborative tasks, while still allowing individual bot pings for specific requests.

**Workaround:**
Currently users must ping each bot individually (`@Bot1 @Bot2`) or bots can react with 👀 to acknowledge role pings without responding.
