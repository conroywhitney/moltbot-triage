## Description

## Feature Request

The `/status` command should display:

1. **Heartbeat interval** - Currently configured via `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every` (e.g., `1h`)
2. **Model** - The current model being used for the session

This gives users quick visibility into their agent's configuration without needing to dig into config files.

### Current behavior
`/status` shows session info but not heartbeat or model.

### Expected behavior
`/status` output includes lines like:
- `Heartbeat: 1h`
- `Model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`
