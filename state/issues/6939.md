## Description

## Description
When the primary model in the config is set to an invalid/unknown model name (e.g., `moonshotai/kimi-k2-0711-preview`), the system crashes instead of falling back to the next model in the fallback chain.

## Expected Behavior
If the primary model is invalid or unrecognized, OpenClaw should gracefully fall back to the next model in the `fallbacks` array.

## Actual Behavior
The system throws `Error: Unknown model: moonshotai/kimi-k2-0711-preview` and stops completely. No fallback occurs.

## Logs
```
lane task error: lane=main durationMs=0 error="Error: Unknown model: moonshotai/kimi-k2-0711-preview"
```

## Impact
If the user is away from their computer, the entire system becomes unresponsive until they manually fix the config. This defeats the purpose of having a fallback chain.

## Suggested Fix
Validate model names at config load time OR treat "unknown model" errors the same as API failures and trigger fallback.

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0, arm64)
- Node: v25.5.0
