## Description

**Description:**

Currently, OpenClaw agents can successfully send WhatsApp polls to users via the `message.poll` tool. However, there is no documented mechanism or tool available for an agent/skill to *receive, listen for, or programmatically process* a user's responses to these polls.

This limitation prevents the implementation of crucial interactive workflows, such as:

*   **Interactive Task Management:** Marking todo list items as complete (or deferring them) directly from a poll response.
*   **Surveys and Feedback:** Collecting structured input from users via polls.
*   **Dynamic User Interactions:** Any scenario where an agent needs to react to specific choices made by a user in a WhatsApp poll.

**Requested Functionality:**

We request a new mechanism or an extension to existing tooling that allows OpenClaw agents/skills to:

1.  **Detect and receive** an event when a user responds to a WhatsApp poll created by the agent.
2.  **Access details** from this response, including:
    *   The `messageId` of the original poll.
    *   The `userId` or `phoneNumber` of the responder.
    *   A list of options selected by the user.

This could potentially be implemented as:

*   A new tool (e.g., `message.onPollResponse(callback_function)`).
*   A specific type of inbound message event that agents can listen for.
*   An extension to existing `message` or `channel` tools to include `pollResponse` data.

Implementing this functionality would significantly enhance the interactive capabilities of OpenClaw agents, particularly for channels like WhatsApp where polls are a natural form of interaction.

**Additionally, similar limitations exist for inbound WhatsApp Emoji Reactions:**

Currently, OpenClaw agents lack a mechanism to directly receive or process user-initiated emoji reactions to messages. While agents can send reactions (via the `whatsapp react` tool) and the system can auto-ack messages with reactions, there is no way for an agent to detect when a user *reacts to one of the agent's messages* (or any message where the agent needs to be aware of the reaction).

This prevents context-sensitive follow-ups based on user sentiment or acknowledgment, such as:
*   Confirming receipt of information (e.g., user reacts with "👍").
*   Acknowledging understanding or agreement.
*   Triggering specific workflows based on a negative or questioning reaction.

**Requested Functionality (for Emoji Reactions):**

We request a new mechanism or an extension to existing tooling that allows OpenClaw agents/skills to:

1.  **Detect and receive** an event when a user reacts with an emoji to a message within a WhatsApp chat managed by the agent.
2.  **Access details** from this reaction event, including:
    *   The `messageId` of the message being reacted to.
    *   The `userId` or `phoneNumber` of the reactor.
    *   The `emoji` character used in the reaction.
    *   Whether the reaction was added or removed.

This functionality would further close the feedback loop for interactive conversations on WhatsApp, allowing agents to respond more dynamically to nuanced user input beyond just text messages and polls.
