## Description

## Summary
Add support for Meta's official WhatsApp Cloud API as an alternative channel provider to the current Baileys (WhatsApp Web) implementation.

## Motivation
- **Stability**: Official API is 100% stable and supported by Meta
- **No phone dependency**: Doesn't require a phone to stay online
- **Business use cases**: Better suited for commercial/business applications requiring 100% uptime
- **Compliance**: Official channel for business messaging

## Current State (Baileys)
- Free, works well for personal use
- Unofficial (minimal ban risk but exists)
- Depends on phone being online

## Proposed Implementation
- New channel type: `whatsapp-cloud` or config flag in existing `whatsapp` channel
- Support Cloud API authentication (Business ID, Phone Number ID, Access Token)
- Webhook receiver for incoming messages
- Message sending via Cloud API endpoints

## Trade-offs to Consider
- **Cost**: ~R$0.05/msg for Utility messages in Brazil (per-message pricing)
- **Requirements**: Meta Business verification, dedicated phone number, CNPJ (for Brazil)
- **Complexity**: Webhook setup, token management

*Requested by user for business/high-availability use cases while keeping Baileys as the default for personal use.*
