## Description

## Description

The heartbeat system is incorrectly attempting to read `HEARTBEAT.md` from skill directories when it should only look in the workspace root.

## Expected Behavior

According to the `skill-creator` documentation, a skill should only contain:
- `SKILL.md` (required)
- Optional bundled resources: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`

The `HEARTBEAT.md` file should ONLY be present in the workspace root (e.g., `~/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md`), not in individual skill directories.

The documentation even explicitly states that skills should NOT contain extraneous files like `README.md`, `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`, etc.

## Actual Behavior

When a heartbeat runs, the system tries to read `HEARTBEAT.md` from within the skill directory:

```
Файл clawd/github-promoter/HEARTBEAT.md не найден. 📁
```

## Reproduction Steps

1. Create a skill directory (e.g., `~/clawd/github-promoter/`)
2. Create `SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter
3. Add `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` as needed
4. Run a heartbeat
5. Error occurs: HEARTBEAT.md not found in skill directory

## Proposed Fix

The heartbeat system should:
1. Only search for `HEARTBEAT.md` in the workspace root directory (e.g., `~/clawd/`)
2. NOT attempt to read it from skill directories
3. Follow the documented skill structure consistently

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: (check with `openclaw status`)
- Workspace: `~/clawd/`
- Skill: `github-promoter`

## Additional Context

This affects any skill that doesn't have an extraneous `HEARTBEAT.md` file, which is the correct behavior according to the skill creation documentation. Skills should be self-contained and focused on their specific functionality without requiring workspace-level configuration files.
