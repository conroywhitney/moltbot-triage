## Description

**Description:**
The `openclaw plugins install <path>` command hangs indefinitely when attempting to install a local plugin.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Clone a plugin repo locally (e.g., https://github.com/knostic/openclaw-telemetry)
2. Run: `openclaw plugins install /path/to/plugin`
3. Command hangs with no output or error messages
4. Process must be killed manually (Ctrl+C or kill)

**Expected behavior:**
Plugin should install successfully or return an error message if installation fails.

**Actual behavior:**
Command hangs indefinitely. No timeout, no error, no progress indicator.

**Environment:**
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Node.js: v22.22.0
- Plugin being installed: openclaw-telemetry from https://github.com/knostic/openclaw-telemetry

**Additional context:**
- `openclaw plugins list` also hangs (same behavior)
- Plugin repos have valid `openclaw.plugin.json` manifests
- Plugins load fine when installed manually in `node_modules`

**Workaround:**
None currently available for local plugin installation.

**Impact:**
Blocks installation of third-party security/observability plugins from the Knostic toolset.
