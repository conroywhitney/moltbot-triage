## Description

## Description
Running native commands (`/status`, `/think`, possibly others) in webchat causes the model to lose all prior conversation context on subsequent turns. The webchat UI continues to display the full history, but the model receives an empty/minimal context.

## Reproduction
1. Start a webchat session and have a conversation (build up some history)
2. Run a native command like `/status` or `/think`
3. Send another message to the model
4. Model responds without any awareness of prior conversation

## Expected behavior
Native commands should not affect the context sent to the model. They're UI/config commands that don't involve model inference.

## Actual behavior
After a native command, the session persists (same session ID, UI shows history), but the context assembly step no longer includes prior messages when building the prompt for the model.

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Channel: webchat
- OS: Windows 10

## Notes
- Session ID remains the same throughout
- No compaction triggered
- Tested with contextPruning both on and off — same behavior
