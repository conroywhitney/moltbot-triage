## Description

## Summary
Sub-agent announces (via `sessions_spawn`) do not deliver results back to webchat sessions because webchat is filtered from delivery resolution.

## Current Behavior
When a sub-agent completes a task spawned from a webchat session, the announce step runs but the result is never delivered back to the webchat UI. The sub-agent's work completes successfully, but the user never receives the automatic report.

## Expected Behavior
Sub-agent announces should deliver results back to webchat sessions, similar to how they work with Telegram, Discord, and other channels.

## Context
Found this note in `docs/experiments/plans/cron-add-hardening.md`:
> "Should we allow webchat as an explicit delivery provider (currently filtered in delivery resolution)?"

This suggests the limitation is intentional but the use case for webchat delivery is valid.

## Use Case
Users interacting via the Control UI webchat or macOS/iOS app should receive sub-agent results automatically without needing to manually poll `sessions_list` or `sessions_history`.

## Workaround
Currently relaying results manually by checking `sessions_list` and pulling `sessions_history` when sub-agents complete.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: webchat (Control UI)
