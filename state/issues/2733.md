## Description

## Context

When a background exec session completes, Clawdbot notifies the user with the output. Currently this includes stderr warnings even when the process succeeded (exit code 0).

## Suggestion

When exit code is 0, filter out common warning patterns (npm warn, deprecation notices) or only show meaningful output.
