## Description

## Problem

In a multi-agent setup, the Control UI's session list shows the same Key for different agent sessions, making them indistinguishable.

**Example:**
| Key (shown) | Actual Key | Agent |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| 123456789 | agent:main:main | main |
| 123456789 | agent:running-coach:main | running-coach |
| 123456789 | agent:helloon-pm:main | helloon-pm |

All sessions with the same user show as `123456789` because:
1. `displayName` is null by default
2. UI falls back to `deliveryContext.to` (user ID)
3. All agents talking to the same user → identical display

## Expected Behavior

Session list should show the agent name or full key to distinguish sessions:
- `main: 123456789` or
- `agent:main:main` (full key option)

## Workaround

Manually set `displayName` in each agent's `sessions.json`:
```bash
jq '.["\agent:main:main"].displayName = "My Agent"' ~/.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json
```

## Environment
- Moltbot 2026.1.27-beta.1
- Multi-agent setup with 5+ agents
- All agents configured for same user
