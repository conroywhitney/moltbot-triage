## Description

## Description

Large assistant replies in the Control UI WebChat cause a rendering glitch where the message area turns into a large blue box. The UI becomes unresponsive during this time, and queued user messages sometimes disappear.

## Environment

- **OpenClaw version:** 2026.2.1
- **Gateway mode:** local, accessed via Tailscale Serve (`gateway.tailscale.mode: serve`)
- **Browsers affected:** Safari (macOS) and Brave (macOS) — both exhibit the same behavior
- **Devices:** Occurs on both a Mac mini (M-series, gateway host) and a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (remote via Tailscale)
- **OS:** macOS Sequoia

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start gateway with Tailscale Serve enabled
2. Open Control UI via Tailscale URL (e.g. `https://<hostname>.ts.net/`)
3. Send a message that triggers a long/detailed assistant response (tables, code blocks, multi-section replies)
4. Observe the message area

## Expected Behavior

Message renders progressively or fully without UI disruption. Queued messages in the input are preserved.

## Actual Behavior

- The message area turns into a **large blue box** during rendering
- UI hangs/freezes momentarily
- User messages queued in the input field sometimes disappear after the render completes
- Requires waiting for the render to finish before the UI becomes usable again

## Notes

- Reproducible across two different browsers (Safari and Brave), suggesting it's not browser-specific
- Happens on both the local machine (Mac mini) and remote machine (MacBook Pro) via Tailscale
- More severe with longer responses (large tables, multi-section markdown, code blocks)
- May be related to how the Lit web components handle large markdown-to-HTML rendering in a single frame, or WebSocket message buffering over the Tailscale tunnel
