## Description

**Bug: `spawn EBADF` error on all exec tool calls**

**Environment:**
- macOS 15.6.0 (arm64) — Mac mini
- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Tested on Node v25.4.0 and v22.x (same issue on both)
- exec config: `security: "full"`, `ask: "off"`

**Problem:**
The exec tool fails with `spawn EBADF` on every command. Browser tool works fine (can start Chrome, navigate, etc.), but any exec call fails immediately.

**Error from gateway logs (verbose mode):**
```
[exec] spawn failed (spawn EBADF syscall=spawn errno=-9); retrying with no-detach.
tools: exec failed stack: Error: spawn EBADF
    at ChildProcess.spawn (node:internal/child_process:420:11)
    at spawn (node:child_process:796:9)
    at spawnAndWaitForSpawn (file:///...clawdbot/dist/process/spawn-utils.js:28:19)
    at spawnWithFallback (file:///...clawdbot/dist/process/spawn-utils.js:78:33)
    at runExecProcess (file:///...clawdbot/dist/agents/bash-tools.exec.js:284:36)
```

**What I've tried (none fixed it):**
- Machine reboot
- Gateway restart (`pkill -f clawdbot-gateway && clawdbot gateway start`)
- npm update/reinstall (`npm uninstall -g clawdbot && npm install -g clawdbot`)
- Downgrading from Node 25 to Node 22 LTS
- Clearing `/tmp/clawdbot-*`

**Key observation:**
Node itself spawns fine:
```bash
node -e "require('child_process').execSync('echo hello', {stdio:'inherit'})"
# Output: hello
```

So the issue is specific to how Clawdbot's `spawn-utils.js` calls spawn, not a system-level problem.

Check how many files are in your workspace, especially the skills directory. I had a python venv in there adding 40k files causing it to fail because the file watcher used up all the file descriptors.
PR to fix my specific issue causing the `spawn EBADF` I had: https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/pull/3845

### @AbhishekkSaini (2026-01-29)

Hi Kyle,
Thanks for the insight. That makes sense — I’ll check the workspace file count, especially the skills directory, and remove any unnecessary environments (like venvs or large dependency folders).
I’ll also take a look at PR #3845. Appreciate you pointing this out.

Thank you for this insight guys, Had the same issue but could not figure out why this was happening. Looks like it was my 600 MB Fast-whisper skill that caused the issue. Move it out and and shell commands now work great. Much appreciated !

I have impelmented fix in my local using claude, and it';s working with the fast-whisper skill

Problem: Chokidar file watcher was creating watchers for all files inside .venv directories in skills, causing FD exhaustion → spawn
  EBADF errors.

  Root cause: DEFAULT_SKILLS_WATCH_IGNORED in refresh.ts was missing Python directories.

  Fix: Added .venv, venv, __pycache__, and other Python/build dirs to the watcher ignore list.

  File: src/agents/skills/refresh.ts

  export const DEFAULT_SKILLS_WATCH_IGNORED: RegExp[] = [
    // existing...
    /(^|[\\/])\.venv([\\/]|$)/,
    /(^|[\\/])venv([\\/]|$)/,
    /(^|[\\/])__pycache__([\\/]|$)/,
    // + other Python cache dirs
  ];

  Result: 712MB faster-whisper skill with .venv now works without EBADF. FD count stays at ~60 instead of exhausting.

But I would recommend someone to validate this again
