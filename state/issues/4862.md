## Description

## Summary
I'm trying to get my bot to schedule social media messages. It's giving me an error that it can't figure out the formatting for the built in cron tool. 

## Steps to reproduce
1. Schedule X post
2. Get error

## Expected behavior
I expected moltbot to use it's cron job tool

## Actual behavior
It gives me errors saying it can't figure out the formate of the cron.add call

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Mac Intel
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
It's installed in an nvm directory in node 22

## Logs or screenshots

-------From Moltbot------
I see the problem. There isn't a cron.md file directly in the docs/tools/ directory.

However, based on the file names, it's possible that documentation for cron jobs is embedded within a more general tool or concepts file. "index.md (http://index.md/)" is a possibility. "agent-send.md (http://agent-send.md/)" or "subagents.md (http://subagents.md/)" might also have relevant information if cron jobs are considered a form of agent interaction.

I will start by reading index.md in the docs/tools/ directory, as it's often a good starting point for overviews. If that doesn't yield the answer, I can then explore other relevant files or try to read the main README.md for the entire Clawdbot project for general configuration guidelines.

I've reviewed the general tools documentation, and unfortunately, it refers to the cron.add RPC schema without actually providing it. This means I still don't have the precise structure required for the job parameter to schedule the evening post.

------End from Moltbot-----

So I have fallen back to the system cron tool which gives me all kinds of permissions errors. I would like to be able to use the buitin cron tool if possible.

I'm having a very similar issue, I put some notes into the PR with logs

looks like the bot's able to use the builtin cron skill but only after reading the SKILL.md from the skills/ez-cronjob skill which seems to been from clawdhub. I didn't install it, so I think the clawdbot wizard did it. The openclaw bot says this skill's not available in clawhub. According to its README.md, it's from https://github.com/ProMadGenius/clawdbot-skills
