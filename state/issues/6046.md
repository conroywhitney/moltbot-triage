## Description

## Bug Description

On session initialization, the Signal plugin attempts to glob for data files using the phone number pattern, which fails because signal-cli stores account data under a numeric ID, not the phone number.

## Error Message

```
zsh:1: no matches found: /Users/<user>/.local/share/signal-cli/data/+1XXXXXXXXXX*
zsh:1: no matches found: /Users/<user>/.config/signal-cli/data/+1XXXXXXXXXX*
```

## Expected Behavior

The plugin should read `~/.local/share/signal-cli/data/accounts.json` to resolve the phone number to the correct data path.

## Actual Behavior

The plugin globs for `+1XXXXXXXXXX*` which matches nothing, and zsh throws an error.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- signal-cli version: 0.13.23
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)
- Shell: zsh
