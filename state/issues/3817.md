## Description

## Summary
Currently the two options for tools.web.search are brave and perplexity - both external search options

It would be much more self-sufficient to be able to configure for self hosted searx or firecrawl search capability.

Further, Brave has a limited free tier.

Further, external requests can result in information leakage from confidential self-hosted environments.

## Proposed solution
Provide a searx option:

{
  tools: {
    web: {
      search: {
        provider: "searx",
        searx: {
          apiKey: "searx-...",
          baseUrl: "http://searx.local",
          params: [defaultSearxParams]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Provide a firecrawl search option:

{
  tools: {
    web: {
      search: {
        provider: "firecrawl",
        firecrawl: {
          apiKey: "fc-...",
          baseUrl: "http://firecrawl.local",
          params: [defaultFirecrawlSearchParams]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

## Alternatives considered
Using searx and firecrawl skills - results in inconsistent behaviour.
