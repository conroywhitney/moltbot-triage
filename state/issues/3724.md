## Description

## Feature Request

### Summary
Allow users to interrupt an in-progress inference by editing or deleting the message that triggered it.

### Use Case
When the assistant gets stuck in a long operation or starts doing something unwanted, users currently have to:
- Use `/stop` (which works but is not intuitive)
- Wait for it to finish
- Restart the gateway via SSH

Editing or deleting the triggering message is a more natural UX — it is what users instinctively try to do.

### Proposed Behavior

**Edit message:**
- Abort current inference for that session
- Re-process with the edited message content

**Delete message:**
- Abort current inference for that session
- No re-process (just stop)

### Technical Context
Telegram already sends `edited_message` and `deleted_message` events to bots. The gateway would need to:
1. Track which message ID triggered the current inference
2. Listen for edit/delete events on that message ID
3. Abort the inference if detected

### Alternatives Considered
- `/stop` works but is not discoverable for new users
- Custom webhook handlers are possible but fragile

Thanks for considering!
