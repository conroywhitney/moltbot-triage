## Description

## Summary

Pressing the **Stop** button in the UI only aborts the streaming response. Background processes spawned by tool calls (`exec`, `browser`, etc.) keep running, leading to zombie processes.

## Proposed solution

Add an **abort endpoint** to the Gateway that:
1. Receives the abort signal from the UI
2. Kills any running `exec` sessions from the current turn

## Alternatives considered

- Manual "stop" keyword handling in SOUL.md (requires extra user message)
- Timeout-based auto-cleanup (could kill legitimate long-running tasks)

## Additional context

- **UI:** [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) - connects to Clawdbot Gateway via OpenAI-compatible API
- Open WebUI's Stop button calls the standard OpenAI abort mechanism, but Gateway doesn't propagate this to running tool processes
- Reproducible with any long-running command (`sleep 300`)
- Environment: Open WebUI + Clawdbot Gateway + WSL2
