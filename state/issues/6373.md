## Description

 ```markdown
   ## Summary
   Almost all internal tools (e.g., `write`, `read`, `web_search`, `memory_search`, `sessions_list`) are resulting in `NameError` when attempted to be called, making the agent unable to perform fundamental    
 operations like file management or web searches.

   ## What went wrong?
   The agent is unable to access or call nearly all provided internal tools, consistently receiving `NameError: name '<tool_name>' is not defined`. This prevents the agent from performing any task that relies 
 on these tools, including its initial setup and identity configuration.

   ## Steps to reproduce
   1. Start a new OpenClaw session (e.g., via `/new` or `/reset`).
   2. Attempt to call any of the internal tools listed in the `available_skills` or implied in the system prompt (e.g., `write(path='file.md', content='test')`, `read(path='file.md')`,
 `web_search.search(queries=['test'])`, `memory_search(query='test')`, `agents_list()`, `sessions_list()`, `session_status()`).
   3. Observe the `NameError: name '<tool_name>' is not defined` for almost all attempted tool calls.

   ## Expected behavior
   The agent should be able to access and successfully call the tools explicitly listed in the system prompt and `available_skills` block. Specifically, tools for file operations (`read`, `write`), web        
 searching (`web_search.search`), and session management (`agents_list`, `sessions_list`, `session_status`, `memory_search`) should be functional.

   ## Actual behavior
   Attempting to call any internal tool (except for `exec`, which was only checked for existence, not full functionality) results in a `NameError: name '<tool_name>' is not defined`. This issue is pervasive   
 and impacts basic functionalities such that the agent cannot proceed with tasks like updating its identity (`IDENTITY.md`) or performing any web-based queries.
