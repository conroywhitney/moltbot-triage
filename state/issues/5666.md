## Description

## Summary

What went wrong?
I am trying to connect via chrome relay plugin Mac OS Tahoe
## Steps to reproduce

1. replay plugin on tab is on 
2. I tried to chat and asked open claw to read the page
3.

## Expected behavior

What did you expect to happen?

## Actual behavior

What actually happened?

I can see the `bbc - Google Search` tab via the relay, but the control attempt still fails with the same Chrome CDP error:

> `Protocol error (Target.attachToBrowserTarget): {"code":-32000,"message":"Not allowed"}`

So even with the latest tweaks, from this side **nothing has changed**: Chrome is still refusing the attach that the relay uses.

At this point, given:

- We’ve reinstalled the extension,
- Tried different Chrome versions,
- Reattached tabs multiple times,
- And I cannot alter the gateway/relay/Chrome launch configuration from here,

I have to treat Browser Relay as **blocked** in this environment.


## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.29
- OS: macOS  Tahoe
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc):npx
