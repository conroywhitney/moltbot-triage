## Description

When the primary Google Gemini CLI provider hit its rate limits/cooldown, Clawdbot issued a `FailoverError: No available auth profile for google-gemini-cli (all in cooldown or unavailable)`. 

Expected behavior: Despite the primary provider's temporary unavailability, Clawdbot should attempt to use subsequent models configured in the `fallbacks` list, even if they belong to different providers (e.g., OpenRouter models). 

Observed behavior: The error message suggests that the entire `google-gemini-cli` profile being down prevented fallback attempts to other, available providers/models. This indicates a potential logic flaw where provider-level unavailability is not correctly allowing progression to the next *provider* in the failover chain. 

Relevant configuration (from `config.get` output): 
```yaml
primary: "google-gemini-cli/gemini-2.5-pro"
fallbacks:
  - "openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash"
  - "openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini"
  - "openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1"
  - "openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2"
  - "openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.1"
```

Error observed: `FailoverError: No available auth profile for google-gemini-cli (all in cooldown or unavailable).`

This impacts resilience and reliability. Requesting investigation and fix.
