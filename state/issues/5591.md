Hi @bryanray , it turns out the defective install.ps1 failed to resolve to the node.exe executable. 
the install.ps1 script works for some environments but not every. This script does the same thing as 
```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```
if your goal is to install the program successfully, the running above command in cmd.exe is a **workaround** to unblock. otherwise, ensure node.exe and npm.exe or npm.cmd are in the PATH and known by your **Powershell** and run the `iwr -useb https://molt.bot/install.ps1 | iex` again.

Let's wait for someone to improve it.
