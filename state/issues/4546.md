## Description

During `openclaw update`, the restore step fails with:

✗ restore control-ui (12ms)
error: pathspec 'dist/control-ui/' did not match any file(s) known to git

The `dist/` directory is in `.gitignore`, so git doesn't track these files.

Impact: Low — control-ui rebuilds anyway, but the error is confusing.

Fix suggestion: Skip git restore for gitignored paths, or catch the error silently.

Environment: OpenClaw 2026.1.29, Ubuntu Linux 6.8.0-90-generic
