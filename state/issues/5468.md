## Description

## Description
The  feature (documented as global for all channels) works inconsistently on Slack. After configuring:


## Expected Behavior
👀 reacts immediately on every incoming Slack message, clears after reply.

## Actual Behavior
Reactions appear ~50% of the time. No error logs. Manual  API calls with same bot token work 100% of the time, ruling out token scope issues.

## Environment
- OpenClaw 2026.1.29
- Slack Socket Mode
- Bot token with  scope confirmed
- Gateway restarted after config change

## Logs
No reaction-related errors or attempts visible in logs when feature fails.

OpenClaw Maintainer Triage // Issue Closure

Hi — this is a joint maintainer effort to keep the repo moving. We’re currently seeing ~30 new issues per hour, and we can’t review every future request without slowing down critical stabilization work. This issue is unlikely to be considered in the near term, so we’re closing it to keep the pipeline moving while we focus on stability.

We’re very sorry this is happening, but we won’t be able to look at the comments on this issue.

Want to make your request stand out? Submit a PR and report to #pr-thunderdome-dangerzone on Discord — READ THE TOPIC. Give us a clear briefing: what it fixes, who it helps, and why it’s worth shipping.

Thanks for understanding and for contributing.
