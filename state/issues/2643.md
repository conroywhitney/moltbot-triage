## Description

## Description

When a user sends a message while the agent is processing or immediately after a previous message, the message can be silently dropped due to the "consecutive user turns" prevention logic.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Send a message to the bot
2. Quickly send another message before the bot responds
3. The second message may be silently dropped

## Expected Behavior

Messages should be queued and processed, not dropped. If consecutive user messages need to be merged or handled specially, they should not be silently discarded.

## Actual Behavior

The log shows:
```
"Removed orphaned user message to prevent consecutive user turns"
```

The message is dropped without any notification to the user, causing confusion when the bot never responds to what they said.

## Suggested Fix

Instead of dropping the message, consider:
1. Queuing it for processing after the current response
2. Merging consecutive user messages into one
3. At minimum, logging a warning that the user can see

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Telegram
- Node: v22.22.0

## Log Evidence

```
2026-01-27T07:17:36.895Z WARN agent/embedded: Removed orphaned user message to prevent consecutive user turns. runId=... sessionId=...
```
