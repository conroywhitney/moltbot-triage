## Description

## Feature Request

**Problem:**
When sending messages to WhatsApp group chats, @mentions show up as raw LID numbers (e.g. `@104539755684040`) instead of resolving to the person's display name. This looks broken and confusing to other group members.

**Expected behavior:**
Mentions should render as proper @Name tags in WhatsApp group chats, just like when a human tags someone natively.

**Technical context:**
WhatsApp's protobuf message format supports mentions via `ContextInfo.MentionedJID` in the whatsmeow library. The JID (`phone@s.whatsapp.net`) needs to be included in the `MentionedJID` array, and the corresponding text should contain `@phone` at the mention position.

**Current workaround:**
Using plain text names instead of @mentions (e.g. writing "Sanskar" instead of attempting `@Sanskar`).

**References:**
- whatsmeow `ContextInfo` proto: `MentionedJID []string`
- WhatsApp Web internally uses this for all group mentions
