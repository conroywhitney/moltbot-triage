## Description

 ## Summary
   Currently, the `web_search` tool uses a single model configured in `tools.web.search.perplexity.model`. To use different Perplexity models (e.g.,
 `sonar` for simple queries vs `sonar-pro` for complex analysis), users must manually update the config and restart the gateway.

   ## Proposed Solution
   Add an optional `model` parameter to the `web_search` tool:

   ```javascript
   web_search({
     query: "Nick Saban",
     model: "sonar-pro"  // optional override
   })
 ```

 If not specified, fall back to the configured default in tools.web.search.perplexity.model.

 Use Case

 Users could choose search complexity on a per-query basis:
 - Simple lookups: sonar (faster, cheaper)
 - Complex analysis: sonar-pro (deeper reasoning)
 - Specific capabilities: Any other Perplexity model as needed

 Current Workaround

 Manually edit config + restart gateway each time you want to switch models.

 Benefit

 More flexible, token-efficient searches without config changes or restarts.
