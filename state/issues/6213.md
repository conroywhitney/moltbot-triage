## Description

## Summary

I have a small question. I’m not sure whether it’s a system issue or a model issue. When I use scheduled tasks, if I create a one-time task—for example, it’s currently 7:20 and I create a reminder for 30 minutes later to remind me to go out and pick up a package—OpenClaw creates the task, but it executes immediately instead of after 30 minutes. The At parameter time is also incorrect when creating the task. Could someone test this and provide feedback? Thank you.
