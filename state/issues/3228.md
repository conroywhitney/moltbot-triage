## Description

## Bug Description
Messages intended for one Discord channel are sometimes being delivered to a different channel in the same guild.

## Observed Behavior
- Messages for `#blocks` (channel ID: `1465975727718400010`) are routing to `#blockgen` (channel ID: `1465964264169672887`)
- Both channels are in the same guild (`511650126486568982`)
- Wildcard routing is configured (`*` with `requireMention: false`)

## Expected Behavior
Messages should be delivered to the channel they originated from / were intended for.

## Possible Causes
- Session key collision or confusion between channels in the same guild
- `deliveryContext` being cached/reused incorrectly across sessions  
- Race condition when multiple channel sessions are active simultaneously

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Discord
- Config: Open group policy, wildcard channel routing

## Reproduction
Having multiple active sessions in different channels of the same guild, then sending messages — some messages end up in the wrong channel.
