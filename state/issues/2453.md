## Description

## Description

When using Claude Opus 4.5 via Telegram, the model frequently ignores conversation context when the user provides short replies.

## Reproduction Steps

1. User asks: "Save Telegram conversations to Obsidian as summaries"
2. Bot asks: "How often? Daily? Per session? Real-time?"
3. User replies: "リアルタイム" (real-time)
4. Bot responds: "What do you want to do in real-time? Web search? Stock prices?"

The bot interprets "リアルタイム" as a new topic instead of an answer to the previous question.

## Expected Behavior

Short replies ("yes", "that", "real-time", "ok") should be interpreted as responses to the preceding question, not new conversation starters.

## Environment

- clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
- Channel: Telegram
- session-memory hook: enabled
- compaction mode: safeguard

## Comparison

The same model (Claude Opus 4.5) maintains context properly when used via Claude Code CLI. This suggests the issue may be in how Clawdbot formats/passes conversation history to the model.

## Workaround Attempted

Added explicit instructions in SOUL.md:
```
### 1. 会話の文脈を絶対に無視するな
- しゅうの短い返事（「うん」「それ」「リアルタイム」など）は直前の話題への回答
- 新しいトピックだと勝手に解釈するな
```

This helps but doesn't fully resolve the issue.

## Additional Issue: Task context lost after tool failure

Related to the context issue - when a tool (like Whisper transcription) fails or times out:

1. Bot starts transcription: "文字起こし開始するぜ"
2. Tool fails (CUDA error)
3. Bot says: "GPUが使えない、CPUで再試行"
4. CPU attempt is killed (SIGTERM/timeout)
5. Bot **completely forgets the task** and asks: "何か用か？" (What do you need?)

The bot lost all context about what it was supposed to be doing. It should have:
- Reported the error
- Asked if user wants to retry
- Or at least acknowledged the task failed

Instead it acted like nothing happened and asked for a new task.

This suggests tool failures may be causing context/conversation state to be lost or reset.
