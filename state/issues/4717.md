## Description

Background and Motivation

I am an active user of OpenClaw. Although I have limited development experience, I have been closely following the project's progress and would like to contribute some ideas to help this excellent tool grow.

Problem Statement and Opportunity

I have noticed feedback from some users that Openclaw sometimes "fails to complete tasks satisfactorily." From my observation, this issue is often not a limitation of the tool itself but is related to the varying capabilities of the AI models being used—Openclaw's performance usually improves significantly when switched to a more capable model.

This brings me to OpenClaw's existing Skills feature. Its design purpose is to address this exact challenge: by encapsulating verified successful task execution patterns into reusable skills, it reduces dependency on any single model's capability, making execution more stable and repeatable.

However, the lack of a public platform for users to easily share and discover skills greatly limits the potential of this core functionality. It also misses the opportunity to incentivize community co-creation and accelerate ecosystem growth.

Core Proposal: Build an Open Skills Platform/Marketplace

Therefore, I propose advancing the development of an Open Skills Platform. This platform could include the following core features:

1. Skill Publishing and Discovery: Allow users to publish their own created or system-accumulated skills to the platform. Support other users in easily searching, reviewing, and importing them.

2. Quality and Security Governance: Implement a mechanism combining "AI-assisted review + community feedback (e.g., ratings, reports)" to gradually establish a quality and security filter for skills.

3. Ecosystem Incentives (Optional): Support creators in setting reasonable fees for their skills. The platform would facilitate distribution with a small commission, forming a sustainable incentive loop for creation.

4. Organization and Discovery: Provide categorization, tagging, search, and sorting functions to help users quickly locate the skills they need from a vast collection.

Expected Value and Impact

• Significantly Expanded Capability Boundary: The platform could attract global developers and project authors to contribute skills, enabling OpenClaw to rapidly integrate various external tools and workflows. It would evolve from an excellent automation tool into an intelligent agent platform with powerful extensibility.

• Overall Improvement in Execution Efficiency: Users can employ powerful models to create efficient skills for others to invoke directly. This would substantially reduce the overall token consumption, trial-and-error cost, and failure rate for tasks.

• Tangible Improvement in User Experience: When faced with a complex task, a user's first resort could shift from "repeatedly debugging prompts" to "finding a suitable skill," significantly lowering the barrier to use.

• Initiation of a Positive Ecosystem Flywheel: An active Skills platform would become a hub connecting creators and users, attracting more participants. Ultimately, it could form a growth cycle of "More Users → More Skills → Greater Capability → Attracting More Users," propelling OpenClaw to evolve into a continuously growing collaborative ecosystem.

Conclusion

I believe that building an open, sharing platform for the existing Skills feature is a crucial step for OpenClaw's advancement to a higher stage of development. This would not only greatly improve the user experience but also help build the project's ecological advantages, potentially providing a replicable path for the ecosystem development of AI Agents in general.

Thank you for reading this proposal. I look forward to seeing the future development of OpenClaw.

Thank you very much for pointing out ClawdHub. This completely addresses and even surpasses the core idea in my proposal—the functionalities required for an open skills platform. ClawdHub has not only already implemented them but is also quite well-designed.

My earlier observations were limited to the web console, and I missed discovering this already mature core of the ecosystem, which was an oversight on my part. This discovery makes me even more excited because it proves that the OpenClaw community is already on the right path and demonstrates strong execution capability.

Building on this, the value of my proposal could perhaps be updated to: providing community perspective-based support and validation for the development of the existing ClawdHub platform. I particularly agree with and look forward to a future where ClawdHub's capabilities can be integrated into the web console and made as easy to add as extensions in VS Code. This would significantly lower the barrier to discovering and using skills, allowing every user to intuitively experience the richness of the community ecosystem. This will be the most critical step in propelling OpenClaw from an excellent tool toward a thriving intelligent agent platform.
