## Description

## Problem

Currently `timeFormat` only controls 12h/24h display. There's no way to include day-of-week in message envelope timestamps.

## Workaround

Created a `hooks/days-of-week.js` hook that prepends the day name to messages, but this is a workaround rather than native support.

## Proposed Solution

Add an `envelopeDateFormat` config option (or similar) that accepts a full date format string, allowing users to include:
- Day of week (Mon, Tue, etc.)
- Custom date formats
- Timezone abbreviations

Example config:
```yaml
envelopeDateFormat: 'ddd MMM D HH:mm'  # → Mon Jan 26 21:14
```

## Use Case

When reviewing conversation history, having the day-of-week visible makes it much easier to orient temporally without mental date math.
