## Description

## Description

The iOS app attempts to connect to a Linux gateway but gets rejected with `reason=pairing required`. However, no pairing request ever appears in `clawdbot nodes pending`.

## Environment

- **Gateway:** Linux (Ubuntu), Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- **iOS App:** 2026.1.25
- **iPhone Model:** iPhone17,1 (iOS 26.0.0)

## Gateway Config (relevant)

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "mode": "local",
    "bind": "lan"
  },
  "discovery": {
    "wideArea": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

## Logs

```
[bonjour] gateway name conflict resolved; newName="clawdbot (2)"
[ws] closed before connect ... remote=192.168.0.237 ua=Clawdbot/20260125 ... code=1008 reason=device nonce required
[ws] closed before connect ... remote=192.168.0.237 ua=Clawdbot/20260125 ... code=1008 reason=pairing required
[ws] closed before connect ... remote=192.168.0.237 ua=Clawdbot/20260125 ... code=1008 reason=pairing required
(repeated)
```

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run gateway on Linux with `gateway.bind: lan`
2. iOS app discovers gateway via Bonjour (shows as "clawdbot (2)")
3. Tap "Connect" in iOS app
4. Gateway logs show `pairing required` rejections
5. `clawdbot nodes pending` shows no requests

## Expected Behavior

iOS app should send a pairing request that appears in `clawdbot nodes pending`, allowing the user to approve it.

## Actual Behavior

iOS app skips the pairing handshake and tries to connect directly, gets rejected, but never sends a proper pairing request.

Add this to your profile, reboot and the connection is successful.
