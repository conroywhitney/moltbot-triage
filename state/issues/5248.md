## Description

Summary
When a paired Telegram user sends a message to the bot, the message is received by the main agent session, but responses are delivered to webchat instead of back to Telegram. Manual sending via the message tool works, but automatic response routing fails.

Environment
Version: v2026.1.29 (also tested on main branch)
OS: Windows 11 with WSL Ubuntu
Gateway: localhost:18789 (Windows)
Workspace: /home/aflanders/code/clawd (WSL)
Steps to Reproduce
Set up Telegram bot with dmPolicy: "pairing"
Complete pairing flow (/start in Telegram)
Send a message from Telegram to bot
Message appears in logs, displayName changes to telegram:<userid>
Agent generates response but it goes to webchat, not Telegram
Expected Behavior
Responses automatically route back to Telegram chat

Actual Behavior
✅ Message received & processed
✅ Manual message.send() tool works
❌ Automatic response delivery to Telegram fails
❌ Response goes to webchat instead
Analysis
deliveryContext remains {channel: "webchat"} even when Telegram messages arrive. The displayName updates but delivery routing doesn't.

Related
Similar to #4900 (but that was context-overflow specific)

Priority
High - Core bidirectional messaging broken
