## Description

## Feature Request

When a user replies to a specific message in Signal (using the quote/reply feature), the quoted message context should be passed through to the agent.

### Current Behavior
- Agent only sees the new message text
- No indication of which message the user is replying to
- Context is lost

### Desired Behavior
- When a user quotes/replies to a message, include the quoted text in the context
- Similar to how WhatsApp already handles this (shows `<quoted text>` inline)

### Use Case
When the agent sends multiple items (e.g., job listings, options), the user should be able to reply to a specific one and the agent understands which item they're referencing.

### Suggested Format
Could follow the WhatsApp pattern:
```
> [quoted message text]
User's reply here
```

Or include metadata:
```
[replying to message_id: XXXXX]
User's reply here
```

### Environment
- Signal channel via signal-cli
- signal-cli likely already provides the quote context in its events
