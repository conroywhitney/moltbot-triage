## Description

Summary

On Clawdbot version 2026.1.24-3 (commit 885167d), creating reminders via natural language in Telegram direct messages consistently fails and leaves the current session in a broken state.

When asking the bot to set a reminder (for example, “send me a message at 9 AM today” or “remind me tomorrow”), Telegram replies with “An unknown error occurred”. After this happens, the current session becomes unusable and only recovers after sending /reset, starting a new session, or manually clearing sessions.json.

Cron jobs work correctly when created via the CLI using clawdbot cron add, which suggests the issue is specific to the agent-driven natural language reminder path rather than the cron system itself.

⸻

Steps to reproduce
	1.	Start a fresh Telegram DM session with the bot.
	2.	Send any normal message and confirm the bot replies correctly.
	3.	Send a natural-language reminder request, such as “Can you send me a message at 9 AM today?” or “Remind me tomorrow morning.”
	4.	Observe the bot’s response and try to continue the conversation.

Expected behavior

The bot should either successfully create the reminder or return a clear and informative error explaining why the reminder could not be created. Even if reminder creation fails, the session should remain usable and continue responding to messages.

⸻

Actual behavior

The bot replies with a generic message saying “An unknown error occurred”. After this, the current session stops working properly. Subsequent messages fail or receive the same error, and logs indicate the session state has sessionKey set to unknown. The session only recovers after sending /reset, starting a new session, or manually clearing the sessions.json file.
