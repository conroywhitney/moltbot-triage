## Description

### Problem
When a session gets stuck (e.g., infinite polling loop of a dead sub-agent, or a hanging tool call), there is no surgical way to fix it without side effects.
- `/reset` fixes the loop but destroys the session context/history.
- `gateway restart` fixes the loop and keeps context, but disrupts *all* other active sessions (interrupts mid-generation).

### Proposed Solution
Implement a command (CLI: `moltbot session restart <id>` or Chat: `/unstick`) that:
1. Identifies the specific `runId` or worker process for that session.
2. Sends a termination signal (SIGKILL/AbortController) to just that worker.
3. Preserves the in-memory context and `transcript.jsonl`.
4. Spawns a new worker for that session in an IDLE state.

### User Value
Allows recovering from 'zombie' states without data loss or downtime for other users.
