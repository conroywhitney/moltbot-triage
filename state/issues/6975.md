## Description

## Summary
When using `[[reply_to_current]]` or `[[reply_to:<id>]]`, the quoted message excerpt in Telegram replies is truncated. A configurable `replyContextLength` parameter would allow users to control how much of the original message is included in replies.

## Use Case
In longer conversations or when replying to detailed messages, the current truncation loses important context. This is especially noticeable when:
- Replying to messages with multiple points
- Referencing specific details from the original message
- Working through complex multi-step tasks

## Proposed Config
```yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    replyContextLength: 2048  # chars to include in reply quote
```

## Current Workaround
None — the truncation length is not configurable.

## Additional Context
This would complement the existing `textChunkLimit` parameter that controls outgoing message chunking.
