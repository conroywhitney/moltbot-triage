## Description

# Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.2.1
- Node: 22.22.0
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-90-generic

## Bug
Telegram receives messages ✅ but cannot send ❌

**Error:** `Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!`

## Diagnostics
✅ API works via curl and Node.js fetch from shell
✅ Bot is configured and approved
✅ Plugin starts successfully
❌ All outbound Telegram API calls fail with undici network errors

**This suggests an undici-specific network issue** - fetch works fine from shell but fails inside OpenClaw's Telegram plugin.

## Actions Taken
- Approved user via `openclaw pairing approve`
- Restarted gateway multiple times
- Verified bot token and API access (all work via curl)

## Workaround
Inbound only - user sends to Telegram, assistant replies via webchat
