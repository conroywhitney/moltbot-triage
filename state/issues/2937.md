## Description

**Problem:**
Cron jobs scheduled with `wake=now` do not deliver messages to Telegram.

**Evidence:**
- Jobs are visible in agent session logs (they fire and reach the agent)
- Messages appear in webchat control UI
- BUT messages never reach the Telegram app on user's device

**Jobs affected:**
- All jobs using `wake=now`: morning briefing, gym reminders, evening journal
- Test job `wake-now-test` confirmed: job fired at 09:27 UTC, visible in session logs, but never reached Telegram

**Timeline:**
- 2026-01-26 08:08 UTC - Morning briefing received on Telegram (wake=now worked!)
- 2026-01-26 09:00 UTC - DSA study reminder NOT received (wake=next-heartbeat)
- 2026-01-26 09:27 UTC - Wake-now test job fired, visible in session, but NOT received on Telegram (wake=now also failed)

**Expected behavior:**
Jobs with `wake=now` should fire at exact scheduled time and deliver message to Telegram.

**Actual behavior:**
Jobs with `wake=now` fire and reach the agent (visible in session), but the message never makes it to the Telegram app.

**Notes:**
- Jobs with `wake=next-heartbeat` (DSA study) also show the same issue
- Direct `message` tool calls work perfectly (tested at 19:54 UTC)
- This appears to be a delivery/routing issue between the agent and the Telegram channel provider

**Environment:**
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.23-1
- Gateway: Running on Linux 6.8.0-86-generic
- Telegram: Connected, default channel configured
- No errors in gateway logs related to this

I also am facing this issue pretty often and it's awful.

Do you know if it works with any other channel?
