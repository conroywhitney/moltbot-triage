## Description

## Summary
It would be so beneficial to have Canva able to add branding to Moltbot's communications

## Proposed solution
Maybe this could be done with Claude's existing open MCP Canva plugin

## Comments

Moltbot already works with MCPorter. Try that. Ask your bot to "setup the Canva MCP server with MCPorter" and provide it with all the details on the Canva server.
