## Description

## Feature Request

**Summary:** Add support for sending stickers via the Telegram provider.

**Current Behavior:**
```
clawdbot message sticker send --channel telegram --target <chat_id> --sticker-id <id>
Error: Action sticker is not supported for provider telegram.
```

The `message sticker send` command currently only works for Discord.

**Requested Behavior:**
- Support sending Telegram stickers by `file_id` (the sticker ID from Telegram's API)
- Optionally support sending stickers by HTTP URL

**Telegram API Support:**
The [sendSticker](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendsticker) method is supported in the Telegram Bot API:
- Required: `chat_id`, `sticker` (file_id as String, or HTTP URL)
- Optional: `disable_notification`, `reply_to_message_id`, `reply_markup`, etc.

**Use Case:**
Custom sticker pack for assistant to send as expressive reactions/responses in chat, more visually engaging than text or emoji reactions.

Thanks! 🐰
