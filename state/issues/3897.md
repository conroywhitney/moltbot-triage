## Description

## Description
When sending messages via WhatsApp or Telegram, the gateway crashes with:
```
Cannot convert argument to a ByteString because the character at index 7 has a value of 8776 which is greater than 255.
```

## Environment
- macOS 26.2
- Node.js 25.2.1 (also tested with Node 20.19.6)
- moltbot 2026.1.27-beta.1 (from source)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Send a message to the bot via WhatsApp or Telegram
2. The AI responds with Unicode characters (e.g., ≈, →, •)
3. Gateway fails to send the response

## Expected Behavior
Messages with Unicode characters should be sent successfully.

## Actual Behavior
The error message is sent to the user instead of the actual response:
```
[moltbot] Cannot convert argument to a ByteString because the character at index 7 has a value of 8776 which is greater than 255.
```

## Notes
- Character 8776 is "≈" (ALMOST EQUAL TO)
- The error originates from Node.js's undici/fetch when Unicode characters are in HTTP headers
- This affects both Telegram (grammy) and WhatsApp (baileys)
