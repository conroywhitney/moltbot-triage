## Description

## Summary
Currently, Clawdbot's agent binding system is channel-centric rather than user-centric. Each channel connection (Telegram, iMessage, etc.) requires separate bindings to an agent, but there's no built-in way to treat multiple channels as belonging to the same user. This leads to fragmented memory and context when a single user communicates through different channels.

## Proposed solution
1. User identity layer
Introduce a user identity concept that sits above channels;
2. Unified memory access
- All channels bound to the same user should read/write to the same memory files
- Session context should be optionally shareable across channels (with config flag)
- User-specific files should be isolated in `users/<userId>/` directory
3. Agent binding enhancement
The agent automatically inherits all channels associated with that userId.
