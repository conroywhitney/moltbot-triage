## Description

## Problem
When running multiple agents (e.g., main + thesis), gateway restart notifications always post to `agent:main:main` session, even when the restart was triggered by a different agent.

This causes "bleed" where thesis agent restart messages appear in the main agent's chat.

## Current behavior
```json
"sentinel": {
  "sessionKey": "agent:main:main"  // Always main, regardless of which agent triggered
}
```

## Requested behavior
Restart sentinel should post to the session that triggered the restart, or support per-agent sentinel routing in config.

## Use case
Multi-agent setups where agents have distinct chat surfaces (e.g., K-claw for daily use, Scribe/T-Roo for thesis work). Users expect clean separation — thesis restarts shouldn't appear in the main chat.
