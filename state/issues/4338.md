## Description

## Bug Report

### What happened
Gateway crashed with an unhandled promise rejection:

```
02:35:38 [clawdbot] Unhandled promise rejection: TypeError: fetch failed
```

### Expected behavior
Network failures should be caught and handled gracefully. The gateway should log the error and continue running, not crash.

### Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Node: v22.22.0
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)

### Steps to reproduce
Unclear exactly which fetch caused it, but it happened during normal agent operation while making API calls. Possibly a timeout or network hiccup.

### Impact
Gateway crashes require manual restart, which breaks connectivity (Telegram, etc.) until user notices and restarts.

### Suggested fix
Wrap fetch calls in try/catch or add a global unhandled rejection handler that logs but doesn't crash.
