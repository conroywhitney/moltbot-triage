## Description

## Use Case
I want to summon Clawdbot in any DM conversation by saying "Clawd" or "Clawdbot" — even in chats with people not on my allowlist. This already works in groups (with `requireMention: true`), but not in DMs.

## Current Behavior
The iMessage plugin (`monitor-provider.js:156`) skips all `is_from_me=true` messages:

```javascript
if (message.is_from_me)
    return;
```

This means my outbound messages in DMs are never processed, even if they contain trigger patterns.

## Why Self-Chat Works (but regular DMs don't)
Messages.app duplicates self-chat messages — once as `is_from_me: true`, once as `is_from_me: false`. The plugin processes the `false` copy. Regular DMs only have the `true` copy, so they're skipped entirely.

## Proposed Solution
Instead of blanket-skipping `is_from_me=true`, check if:
1. The sender is the owner (on `allowFrom`)
2. The message matches configured `mentionPatterns`

If both conditions are met, process the message and respond in that conversation.

## Scope
This would be valuable for:
- iMessage
- Signal  
- WhatsApp (non-selfChatMode DMs)

## Config Example
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "imessage": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["+1234567890"],
      "ownerTriggerInDMs": true
    }
  },
  "messages": {
    "groupChat": {
      "mentionPatterns": ["clawd", "clawdbot"]
    }
  }
}
```

When I (the owner) DM anyone and say "Hey Clawd, what's the weather?", Clawdbot should respond in that chat.
