I’ve already deployed it on Android, and there are indeed some issues. I’ll continue to monitor them.

I have successfully deployed OpenClaw on my Xiaomi phone, and I can access http://127.0.0.1:18789 directly on the device without any issues.

However, when I try to access http://100.84.142.51:18789 from my computer (using Tailscale), it often causes the gateway to crash, forcing me to perform a reboot.


I used OpenCode to install OpenClaw remotely. Where should I look for the logs now?
