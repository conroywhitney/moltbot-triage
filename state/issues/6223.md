## Description

## Summary

What went wrong?

## Steps to reproduce

1. start gateway service
2. run a cron job via `openclaw cron run <id> --force`

## Expected behavior

The job should be ran normally

## Actual behavior

Errors:
```
Error: gateway timeout after 10000ms
Gateway target: ws://127.0.0.1:18789
Source: local loopback
Config: /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Bind: loopback
```

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Ubuntu 24.0.4
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npm

## Additional Context: Root Cause Found

I experienced the same timeout issue with `openclaw cron list` and found the root cause:

### Problem
- `cron list` and `cron run` commands timing out after 10 seconds
- Gateway is running and responding to other commands
- Logs show cron RPC operations taking 13-120 seconds to complete

### Root Cause
A problematic **wake job** with `lastError: "timeout waiting for main lane to become idle"` was blocking all cron operations. This job had:
- `sessionTarget: "main"`
- `lastStatus: "skipped"`
- `lastDurationMs: 120272ms` (120 seconds!)

### Solution
1. Manually remove the problematic job from `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`
2. Restart the gateway service
3. Cron commands now respond normally (< 1 second)

### Steps to Check
```bash
# Check if you have stuck jobs
cat ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json | grep -A5 'lastError'

# Look for jobs with long lastDurationMs or errors about "waiting for main lane"
```

### Related Issues
This appears related to #6217 (isolated sessions) and #4210 (lock contention during job execution).

**Suggestion**: The cron system should have a timeout/abort mechanism for stuck jobs rather than blocking all RPC operations.
