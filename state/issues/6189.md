## Description

## Description

After a fresh install, avatar images in the chat UI are broken. The CDN path appears to have changed from `clawdhub` to `clawhub`, but the signature validation fails on the new path.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Fresh install of OpenClaw
2. Open webchat UI
3. Avatar images show as broken

## Expected vs Actual

**Working URL (old path):**
```
https://mintcdn.com/clawdhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg?...
```
→ Returns 200 OK

**Broken URL (new path):**
```
https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg?...
```
→ Returns 403 `sig_invalid`

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- OS: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0 arm64)
- Node: v25.5.0

## Analysis

The signature (`s=da2032e9...`) was generated for the old `clawdhub` path but the new version uses `clawhub` path, causing signature mismatch.
