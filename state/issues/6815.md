## Description

## Bug Description

During tool execution in the WebChat interface, a **giant lightning/thunderbolt animation** appears and fills the entire chat window. This makes the interface unusable during tool calls.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open WebChat interface
2. Trigger any tool execution (e.g., `read`, `exec`, `web_search`, etc.)
3. Observe the large lightning/thunderbolt graphic that appears during tool execution
4. The graphic covers the entire chat window, making it difficult to see messages

## Expected Behavior

- A small, compact activity indicator should appear (e.g., a spinner or subtle pulse)
- The indicator should not obscure the chat content
- The indicator should be collapsible or dismissible

## Actual Behavior

- A large lightning/thunderbolt graphic appears
- The graphic fills the entire chat window
- Chat content is obscured during tool execution
- The animation is overly prominent and distracting

## Related Issues

- Issue #4691: WebChat: Show compact animated activity indicator for tools (CLOSED)
  - This issue requested a COMPACT indicator, but the current implementation appears oversized
  - Possible regression or different animation than originally designed

## Environment

- OpenClaw Version: 2026.1.30
- Host OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0)
- Interface: WebChat

## Additional Context

This appears to be different from the compact indicator requested in #4691. The mockup in that issue showed:
```
[ Working... [▼] ]
[ read → config.json ]
[ exec → npm install ]
```

Instead, users are seeing a full-screen lightning/thunderbolt animation.

**Screenshot/video to follow** from reporter.

## Possible Causes

- CSS animation sizing issue
- Missing max-width/max-height constraints on the activity indicator
- Different animation asset than intended
- Responsive design issue where animation scales to fill container
