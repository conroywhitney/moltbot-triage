## Description

### Description
In Discord-based sessions, native Discord stickers sent by users are not being relayed to the agent in the message body or session history. While text, standard emotes, and media attachments function correctly, messages containing stickers appear as text-only strings, with the sticker data completely omitted from the relay payload.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect an OpenClaw agent to a Discord channel.
2. Send a message containing a native Discord sticker to the channel.
3. Observe the agent's input log or session history using `sessions_history`.

### Expected Behavior
The message payload should include sticker metadata (e.g., `stickerId`, `stickerName`) to allow the agent to identify and process the visual content.

### Actual Behavior
The message is received by the agent as a standard text message, but the sticker component is silent and absent from the relay.

### Environment
- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.1.29
- **Plugin:** discord
- **Platform:** Linux 6.14.0-37-generic
