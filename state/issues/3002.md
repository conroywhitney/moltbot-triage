## Description

## Severity: Low

## Description
Some file creation operations may not set restrictive permissions, potentially allowing other users on the system to read sensitive configuration or credential files.

## Location
- Various file creation operations throughout the codebase

## Risk
Sensitive files (config, credentials, tokens) may be readable by other users on multi-user systems.

## Recommendation
- Ensure sensitive files are created with restrictive permissions (e.g., 0600)
- Audit existing configuration files for proper permissions
- Add permission checks on startup for critical files
