## Description

## Summary
Add native tool support for Tavily and Exa search APIs alongside the existing Brave Search integration.

## Motivation
Currently OpenClaw only has `web_search` (Brave) as a built-in search tool. While Brave works well for general searches, Tavily and Exa offer complementary capabilities:

- **Tavily**: Optimized for AI agents, returns structured results with content extraction, supports advanced search depth
- **Exa**: Neural/semantic search that finds conceptually related content (not just keyword matches), great for research

Many users already have API keys for these services. Having them as native tools would be more ergonomic than calling scripts.

## Proposed Implementation
Add optional tools that activate when API keys are configured in `skills.entries`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "tavily": { "enabled": true, "apiKey": "..." },
      "exa": { "enabled": true, "apiKey": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

When configured, expose tools like:
- `tavily_search(query, max_results?, search_depth?)`
- `exa_search(query, num_results?, use_autoprompt?)`

## Workaround
Currently using a custom skill with Python scripts that read API keys from environment variables. Works but not as seamless as native tools.
