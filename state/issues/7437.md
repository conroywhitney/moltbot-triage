## Description

Problem

When listing sessions with sessions_list, cron job sessions display their internal UUIDs instead of their human-readable job names:

key: "agent:main:cron:-87d6-494a-ba28"

This makes it hard to quickly identify which cron job a session belongs to without cross-referencing the cron job list.

Current Behavior

$ sessions_list
# Shows:
agent:main:cron:xxxxxxxx-87d6-494a-ba28-xxxxxxxxxx
agent:main:cron:xxxxxxxx-e0c1-4d73-a373-xxxxxxxx
# etc...

Expected Behavior

$ sessions_list
# Should show:
Imagination Session (cron:2104040d...)
Morning Briefing (cron:54a6a977...)
# OR just:
Imagination Session
Morning Briefing

Solution

When displaying cron-triggered sessions in sessions_list, include or replace the UUID with the job name from the cron configuration.

The job names already exist in the cron config:

• job.name field is populated for all jobs
• The mapping is available via cron list action
Benefits

1. Better UX — Instantly identify which cron job a session represents
2. Easier debugging — Quickly spot which scheduled tasks are running or failed
3. Consistency — Job names are already displayed in cron list, should match in sessions_list
Implementation Suggestion

In the sessions listing logic, when a session key matches agent:main:cron:<uuid>, lookup the corresponding cron job by ID and display its name in the displayName field or append it to the key display.
