## Description

## Problem
When a conversation gets compacted due to context limits, the user has no way of knowing this happened. The agent loses context silently, leading to confusion when it can't recall recent information.

## Proposed Solution
After compaction occurs, automatically send a brief notification to the active channel:
```
⚠️ Context compacted — older messages summarized
```

## Benefits
- User knows to re-share important links/context
- Reduces confusion when agent "forgets" recent info
- Transparent about system limitations

## Implementation Ideas
- Hook into wherever compaction/summarization happens
- Optional config flag to enable/disable (`session.notifyOnCompaction: true`)
- Could include what was lost (e.g., "~50 messages summarized")
