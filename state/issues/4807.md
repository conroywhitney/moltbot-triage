## Description

## Description

When running `openclaw doctor` or the onboarding wizard, if the sandbox Docker image `openclaw-sandbox:bookworm-slim` is missing, the user is prompted to build it. Accepting the prompt fails with:

```
Unable to locate scripts/sandbox-setup.sh. Run it from the repo root.
```

The file `scripts/sandbox-setup.sh` only exists in the source repo and is not included in the npm package. The npm install only ships `scripts/format-staged.js`, `scripts/postinstall.js`, and `scripts/setup-git-hooks.js`.

Looking at the source, the sandbox image is just `debian:bookworm-slim` tagged as `openclaw-sandbox:bookworm-slim`. The fix could be:

1. Bundle `sandbox-setup.sh` in the npm package, or
2. Inline the `docker pull` + `docker tag` logic directly in the doctor/wizard flow instead of shelling out to a missing script

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install openclaw via npm (`npm install -g openclaw`)
2. Have Docker running but no `openclaw-sandbox:bookworm-slim` image
3. Run the setup wizard or `openclaw doctor`
4. Accept the prompt to build the sandbox image
5. Observe the error about missing script

## Workaround

```bash
docker pull debian:bookworm-slim
docker tag debian:bookworm-slim openclaw-sandbox:bookworm-slim
```

## Expected Behavior

The wizard/doctor should be able to build the sandbox image without requiring files only present in the git repo.
