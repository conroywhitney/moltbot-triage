## Description

## Description

Google Antigravity OAuth authentication fails because Google blocks HTTP localhost redirects.

## Error

```
You can't sign in to this app because it doesn't comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 policy for keeping apps secure.
```

## Details

- Redirect URI: `http://localhost:51121/oauth-callback`
- Google now requires HTTPS for OAuth redirects, even for localhost
- This affects all users trying to authenticate with Google Antigravity

## Expected Behavior

OAuth should work with localhost redirects. Options:
1. Use HTTPS for localhost (with self-signed cert)
2. Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` (sometimes treated differently)
3. Implement device code flow as fallback
4. Use a loopback redirect with proper scheme
