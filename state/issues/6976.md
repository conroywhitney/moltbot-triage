## Description

## Description

When using zsh tab completion for `openclaw` commands, the help text descriptions contain excessive backslash escaping, making them difficult to read.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install OpenClaw and set up zsh completions
2. Type `openclaw ` and press Tab to trigger completion
3. Observe the help text for each command option

## Expected Behavior

Clean, readable help text like:
```
gateway  -- Manage the Gateway daemon
browser  -- Control the browser
```

## Actual Behavior

Help text contains excessive backslash escaping:
```
gateway  -- Manage\\ the\\ Gateway\\ daemon
browser  -- Control\\ the\\ browser
```

The backslashes appear before spaces and potentially other characters, making the completion suggestions hard to read.

## Environment

- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 25.2.0, arm64)
- **Shell:** zsh
- **Node:** v24.13.0
- **OpenClaw version:** 2026.1.29

## Additional Context

This appears to be an escaping issue in the completion script generation. The shell metacharacters are being over-escaped when they don't need to be for display purposes in zsh completion descriptions.
