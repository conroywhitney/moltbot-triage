## Description

## Feature Request

**Summary:** Add support for Discord bot presence/status to display the current model and auth profile.

### Use Case
When running Clawdbot with multiple OAuth accounts (e.g., `anthropic:personal` and `anthropic:work`), it would be helpful to see at a glance which model and auth profile the bot is currently using. This information would appear in the Discord bot's presence status (the text shown under the bot's name in the member list).

### Proposed Solution
Add a config option to set a dynamic presence template:

```json5
channels: {
  discord: {
    presence: {
      enabled: true,
      template: "{model} • {authProfile}"  // e.g. "Opus 4.5 • anthropic:work"
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Discord.js provides `client.user.setPresence()` for this
- Presence is **bot-wide** (not per-channel), so this would show the last-active or default model/auth
- Could update on:
  - Gateway start (show default)
  - Model switch (`/model` command)
  - Auth profile change
- Template variables could include:
  - `{model}` — friendly model name (e.g., "Opus 4.5")
  - `{modelFull}` — full model ID (e.g., "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5")
  - `{authProfile}` — auth profile ID (e.g., "anthropic:work")
  - `{provider}` — provider name (e.g., "anthropic")

### Alternatives Considered
- Per-channel status: Not possible with Discord's API (presence is bot-wide)
- Always show default: Less useful when model is overridden per-session

## Use Case: Multiple Auth Profiles

A common setup is having **multiple Anthropic (or other provider) accounts** — for example:
- `anthropic:work` — billed to your company
- `anthropic:personal` — billed to your personal account

You configure these in `auth.profiles` and set the priority order in `auth.order`:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "profiles": {
      "anthropic:work": { "provider": "anthropic", "mode": "oauth" },
      "anthropic:personal": { "provider": "anthropic", "mode": "oauth" }
    },
    "order": {
      "anthropic": ["anthropic:work", "anthropic:personal"]
    }
  }
}
```

The first profile in the order is used by default; the second is a fallback.

**Why presence matters here:** When you switch between work and personal (via config toggle), the bot's Discord presence can reflect which account is currently active. The `{authProfile}` template variable shows this:

```
Opus 4.5 • anthropic:work
```

This makes it easy to see at a glance which billing context the bot is operating in — helpful when you share the bot with others or use it across different contexts.
