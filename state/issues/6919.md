## Description

## Problem

When WhatsApp tool is connected, the agent can send messages to contacts when given the number in the query. But in a new session, the agent doesn't remember previously used contacts and asks for the number again.

## Proposed solution

Persistent CONTACTS.md file in the workspace that stores contact information. This file will be:
1. Created on-demand - Only when the agent first sends a WhatsApp message
2. Auto-updated - When new contact info is provided
3. Injected into system prompt - When WhatsApp channel is configured

Current problem -
