## Description

Summary

  When using OpenClaw in Remote mode (Direct wss, e.g. wss://debian.tail3f156d.ts.net), using Settings → Skills and choosing to install a skill to the Mac
  causes the app to switch from Remote to Local. The app then tries to use a local gateway (e.g. localhost:18789) on the Mac, which is not running, so the
  gateway connection fails and the user sees an authentication/connection error. The user has to manually set Remote again and re-enter the gateway URL to
  recover.

  Steps to reproduce

  1. In OpenClaw, set Clawdbot runs to Remote and Transport to Direct (ws/wss).
  2. Set Gateway URL to your remote gateway (e.g. wss://debian.tail3f156d.ts.net), save, and confirm the app connects (gateway active / health OK).
  3. Open Settings and go to the Skills section.
  4. Pick any skill and use the option to install the skill to the Mac (or “install to this device” / equivalent).
  5. Observe that the app switches to Local and the gateway connection fails (auth/connection error).


  Expected behavior

  The app should stay in Remote mode and keep using the configured remote gateway URL. Only the install target (Mac vs server) should change; the gateway
  mode and URL should not change, and there should be no gateway authentication or connection error.

  Actual behavior

  After starting “install skill to Mac” in Settings → Skills, the app switches from Remote to Local. It then tries to connect to a local gateway (e.g.
  localhost:18789) on the Mac. There is no Clawdbot gateway running locally, so the user sees a gateway authentication/connection failure (e.g. “failed to
  authenticate gateway” or “cannot reach gateway at localhost:18789”). Recovery requires going back to Settings, setting Clawdbot runs back to Remote, and
  re-entering the remote gateway URL (e.g. wss://debian.tail3f156d.ts.net).

  Environment

  • Clawdbot version: (gateway on Linux) e.g. 2026.1.24-3
  • OS: macOS (e.g. 14 / 15), Apple Silicon or Intel; gateway host: Linux (e.g. Debian)
  • Install method: Mac app (OpenClaw) connecting to gateway via Tailscale Serve (wss); gateway on Linux via npm/pnpm/systemd
