## Description

## Bug Description

When a cron job with `sessionTarget: main` and `payload.kind: systemEvent` fires, the reminder message appears in the webchat UI as a **user message** (with the user's icon/bubble) instead of as a system or assistant message.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a cron job with systemEvent payload targeting main session
2. Wait for the reminder to fire while webchat is the active session
3. Observe the reminder appears as a message FROM the user, not as a system message

## Expected Behavior

systemEvent messages from cron should render as system messages or assistant messages, not as user messages.

## Additional Context

- The reminder also did not route to Telegram (only appeared in webchat)
- Workaround: Use `sessionTarget: isolated` with `agentTurn` payload and `deliver: true, channel: telegram` to explicitly route notifications

## Environment

- Moltbot on Windows
- Webchat channel active
