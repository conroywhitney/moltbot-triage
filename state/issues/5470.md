## Description

### Description

OpenClaw creates Slack threads for all channel responses despite `replyToMode: "off"` and `replyToModeByChatType: { "channel": "off" }` being configured. This started after recreating the container on January 30, 2026.

### Environment

- **OpenClaw Version**: 2026.1.29
- - **Platform**: Docker on Ubuntu (VPS)
- - - **Slack Integration**: Socket Mode
- - - - **Channel Type**: Public channel (#lecanaldemichel, ID: C0ABN35FJBF)
- - - - - **Container Created**: 2026-01-30 15:30 UTC
- - - - - - **Issue Started**: 2026-01-30 21:38 UTC (after container recreation)
### Expected Behavior

Based on the [Slack documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/slack):

> `replyToMode: "off"` - Reply in main channel. Only thread if the triggering message was already in a thread.

**Expected**: Bot replies directly in the channel without creating threads.

**Previous behavior** (before Jan 30): Bot replied directly in the channel ✅

### Current Behavior

**Actual**: Bot creates a thread for **every** response, even when replying to a message that is NOT in a thread ❌

Logs confirm delivery to channel:
```
[slack] delivered reply to channel:C0ABN35FJBF
```

But a thread is still created in the Slack UI.

### Configuration

**File**: `/root/.openclaw-delegue/openclaw.json`

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "lastTouchedVersion": "2026.1.24-1",
    "lastTouchedAt": "2026-01-31T14:15:00.000Z"
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "maxConcurrent": 4,
      "model": {
        "primary": "google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-flash-preview"
      }
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "mode": "socket",
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_ECOLE}",
      "appToken": "${SLACK_APP_TOKEN_ECOLE}",
      "groupPolicy": "open",
      "replyToMode": "off",
      "replyToModeByChatType": {
        "channel": "off",
        "direct": "off",
        "group": "off"
      },
      "channels": {
        "C0ABN35FJBF": {
          "allow": true,
          "requireMention": false
        }
      },
      "dm": {
        "enabled": true,
        "policy": "open",
        "allowFrom": ["*"]
      }
    }
  },
  "gateway": {
    "mode": "local",
    "controlUi": {
      "allowInsecureAuth": true
    },
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "delegue-2026"
    },
    "remote": {
      "token": "secure-token-delegue-2026"
    }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "google-gemini-cli-auth": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      "slack": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure OpenClaw 2026.1.29 with Slack Socket Mode
2. 2. Set `replyToMode: "off"` globally
3. 3. Set `replyToModeByChatType: { "channel": "off" }` for channels
4. 4. Configure a public channel with `requireMention: false`
5. 5. Send a message in the channel (NOT in a thread)
6. 6. Observe: Bot creates a new thread instead of replying directly
### What We've Tried

✅ **Attempted Fix 1**: Added `replyToMode: "off"` at root level
- Result: Thread still created
✅ **Attempted Fix 2**: Added `replyToModeByChatType` with all types set to "off"
- Result: Thread still created
Logs confirm config is loaded:
```
[reload] config change detected; evaluating reload (meta.lastTouchedAt, agents.defaults.compaction, channels.slack.replyToModeByChatType)
[slack] socket mode connected
```

### Related Issues

- #2411 - Slack DM threading not working (inverse problem - threading doesn't work in DMs)
- - #4424 - Thread reply routes to main channel when two messages arrive quickly
### Logs

**Before issue (Jan 30 21:40)**:
```
[slack] delivered reply to user:U0AC9HKJM8Q
```

**After issue started (Jan 31 13:50)**:
```
[slack] delivered reply to channel:C0ABN35FJBF
```

Log says "delivered to channel" but Slack UI shows it as threaded.

### Hypothesis

Possible causes:
1. **Bug in 2026.1.29**: Default threading behavior changed without documentation
2. 2. **Regression**: `replyToMode: "off"` config is being ignored for channels
3. 3. **Missing config**: There's an additional config option needed to disable threading completely
### Impact

- Makes channel conversations harder to follow
- - Forces users to click into threads to see bot responses
- - - Breaks previous expected behavior (direct channel replies)
### Environment Details

**Docker Image**: `moltbot:local`
**Image Created**: 2026-01-30T15:30:17Z
**Package Version**: openclaw@2026.1.29 (confirmed via `cat /app/package.json` in container)

**Container logs show**:
```
2026-01-30T21:39:24.785Z [gateway] log file: /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-2026-01-30.log
```

### Request

Please investigate why `replyToMode: "off"` is not preventing thread creation in public channels for OpenClaw 2026.1.29. Is there additional configuration required, or is this a regression?

Happy to provide more logs or testing if needed.

**Additional Context**: This is for a student delegate bot at Rocket School, used by 30+ students. Threading makes it harder for classmates to see bot responses in the shared channel.
