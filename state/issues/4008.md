## Description

Slack voice messages are sent as .mp4 files with video/mp4 MIME type, even though they contain only audio. Clawdbot's
 transcription pipeline checks for audio/* MIME types, so Slack voice messages are not transcribed.

 ### Current Behavior

 - Slack voice message arrives as audio_message.mp4 with video/mp4 MIME type
 - Clawdbot routes it to video understanding (or ignores it), not audio transcription
 - Manual transcription via OpenAI Whisper API works fine on the same file

 ### Expected Behavior

 Slack voice messages should be automatically transcribed like Telegram voice notes.

 ### Technical Details

 - Slack uses MP4 containers for voice messages (audio-only, no video tracks)
 - The filename pattern is audio_message*.mp4
 - Telegram sends voice as audio/ogg → works correctly

 ### Suggested Fix

 1. Check if filename contains audio_message and treat as audio
 2. Or detect if MP4 has no video tracks → treat as audio
 3. Or add a MIME type mapping config option

 ### Environment

 - Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
 - Channel: Slack (Socket Mode)
 - Audio config: tools.media.audio.enabled: true with OpenAI gpt-4o-mini-transcribe

 ### Workaround

 Manual transcription works:

 ```bash
   curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
     -F "file=@/path/to/audio_message.mp4" \
     -F "model=whisper-1"
