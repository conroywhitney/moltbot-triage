## Description

Environment:

• OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
• Platform: macOS (Homebrew)
• Channel: Telegram
Setup:

• Telegram bot with "Topics in Direct Messages" enabled via BotFather
• 1-on-1 DM with topics (not group forum)
Expected behavior:

• Bot replies should appear in the same topic where the user sent their message
Actual behavior:

• Bot replies appear in the main/General topic instead of the user's topic
• Session keys correctly show :thread:<id> suffix (e.g., agent:main:main:thread:22183)
• But outbound messages don't include message_thread_id
Previously working:

• This worked before the 2026.1.30 update
