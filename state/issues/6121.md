## Description

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- OS: Windows 11 (WSL2)
- Channel: WebChat (browser)

## Problem 1: Streaming text rendering bug

**Expected:** Text should stream smoothly, appending new content as it arrives.

**Actual:** Text appears, then disappears, then a larger chunk appears. The experience is "jumpy" - content seems to be replaced rather than appended.

**Technical context:**
- Backend `emitChatDelta` is working (confirmed via code inspection)
- yunyi API supports SSE streaming (confirmed via curl test with `content_block_delta` events)
- Issue appears to be in WebChat frontend rendering of `chat` delta events

## Problem 2: WebSocket disconnects on VPN toggle

**Expected:** WebChat should auto-reconnect when network changes (e.g., VPN on/off).

**Actual:** WebChat disconnects and does not reconnect. User must manually refresh.

**Note:** `web.reconnect` config exists but appears to be for web channel, not WebChat.

## Suggested fix
1. WebChat frontend should append delta text, not replace
2. WebChat should implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (similar to `web.reconnect`)
