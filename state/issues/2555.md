## Description

## Summary

Currently, clawdbot supports various channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Feishu, Nostr, etc.) but lacks native integration with Claude Code (Anthropic's AI-powered coding assistant). As more developers adopt Claude Code for their daily workflows, there's a growing need to orchestrate and control Claude Code sessions programmatically through clawdbot agents.

## Proposed solution

Add a Claude Code agent/extension that allows clawdbot to:

1. **Session Management**: Start, pause, resume, and terminate Claude Code sessions
2. **Command Execution**: Send prompts/instructions to Claude Code and receive responses
3. **Context Sharing**: Pass file context, repository information, and conversation history between clawdbot and Claude Code
4. **Tool Orchestration**: Allow clawdbot agents to invoke Claude Code as a tool for complex coding tasks
5. **Status Monitoring**: Track Claude Code session status, token usage, and operation progress

### Example use cases

- Trigger code reviews via Telegram/Slack and have Claude Code execute them
- Orchestrate multi-step refactoring tasks across repositories
- Integrate Claude Code into existing CI/CD pipelines through clawdbot
- Allow non-technical team members to request code changes through chat interfaces

### Suggested implementation approach

```
clawdbot agent
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ claude-code     │
│ extension       │
├─────────────────┤
│ - session mgmt  │
│ - prompt relay  │
│ - output parser │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Claude Code CLI │
│ or local API    │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Alternatives considered

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **MCP Integration** | Standard protocol, reusable | Requires Claude Code MCP server support |
| **CLI Wrapper** | Simple, works today | Less robust, no session management |
| **WebSocket/API** | Most performant, full control | Depends on Claude Code exposing local API |

## Additional context

- Related to the existing agent tooling infrastructure (`agents` label)
- Similar pattern to how `extensions: google-antigravity-auth` handles OAuth flows
- Claude Code documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
- Labels: `agents`, `enhancement`
