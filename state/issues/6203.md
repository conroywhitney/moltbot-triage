## Description

## Problem Description

When an `Unknown model` error occurs (e.g., `Unknown model: openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`), the fallback model is not triggered even though it should work.

## Expected Behavior

The fallback model should activate in ANY case of model unavailability, including:
- `Unknown model` errors
- Timeouts
- API unavailability
- Configuration errors
- Network issues

## Actual Behavior

OpenClaw returns `Agent failed before reply: Unknown model` and does not attempt to switch to the fallback model.

## Reproduction

1. Main model is set to `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
2. Temporary issue occurs (OpenRouter temporarily doesn't recognize the model)
3. Error appears: `Agent failed before reply: Unknown model: openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
4. Fallback model (configured and working) is NOT activated
5. After some time, the issue resolves on its own (OpenRouter恢复正常)

## Context

- Main model: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
- Fallback: configured (user confirmed)
- Error timestamp: 2026-02-01 ~12:30 CET
- Log command: `openclaw logs --follow`

## Possible Causes

1. `Unknown model` is treated as a fatal configuration error rather than a temporary model issue
2. Fallback logic doesn't trigger during model selection phase
3. Error occurs before fallback mechanism is activated

## Recommendation

Fallback should be triggered for ANY model-related errors, not just specific types. The fallback mechanism should handle all cases where the primary model cannot be used.
