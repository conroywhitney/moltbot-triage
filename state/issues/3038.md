## Description

## Summary
What went wrong?

The documentation mentions the CLI command moltbot gateway status, but the actual working CLI binary is clawdbot. This causes confusion for first-time users when following the official docs.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Follow the official documentation and run:
```bash
moltbot gateway status
```
2. Observe that the command is not found or does not work.
3.Run the actual installed CLI instead:

```bash
clawdbot gateway status
```

## Expected behavior

The CLI command shown in the documentation should match the actual binary name installed by the project.
## Actual behavior

The documentation references moltbot, but the real CLI is clawdbot.


## Environment

Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3 (885167d)

OS: macOS

Install method: npx / pnpm

## Additional context
I suspect this may be a leftover naming change (moltbot → clawdbot).
I’m happy to submit a PR to update the documentation if that’s helpful.

same issue. switching to clawdbot works

I ran into the same issue. I've updated to Node v24.13.0 and npm 11.6.2, and I installed the package via npm install -g moltbot. However, the moltbot command is still not recognized in my terminal.
