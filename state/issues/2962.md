## Description

## Summary

I've been typing to my bot like some kind of caveman. Meanwhile, my bot is RIGHT THERE in Discord, watching me suffer through keyboards like it's 1995.

I want to talk to my bot in Discord voice channels instead of typing. Voice would be way more natural for quick back-and-forth conversations.

## Proposed solution

Add voice channel support with:
- `/join` and `/leave` slash commands
- Speech-to-text via OpenAI Realtime API
- Text-to-speech responses (OpenAI/ElevenLabs/Edge)
- Barge-in support (interrupt bot mid-sentence when it rambles)

Config (`~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`):
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "voice": {
        "enabled": true,
        "selfDeaf": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternatives considered

- **Discord Activities** — too complex, overkill for voice chat
- **Separate voice bot** — defeats the purpose of unified assistant
- **Keep typing like a caveman** — no

## Additional context

Dependencies needed: `@discordjs/voice`, `@discordjs/opus`, `sodium-native`

Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` for transcription.

I have an MR I will open that I am using locally, if this type of enhancement will be accepted.

Back in my day we used to actually type our requests out like real cavemen smh

@0xdsqr PRs welcome, please make sure it uses Carbon's voice plugin (which uses djs voice so code changes shouldn't be too bad from what you have)

Hey @thewilloftheshadow, actually I already am. I just had a small hack to get the callbacks working. Think you might like this?
