## Description

## Summary
Currently, `openclaw logs` displays timestamps in UTC (ISO 8601 format). There's no configuration option to display logs in the user's local timezone.

## Current Behavior
Log entries show UTC time:
```
2026-01-30T09:01:46.999Z debug agent/embedded ...
```

## Desired Behavior
Add a `logging.timezone` config option (similar to `agents.defaults.userTimezone`) that allows users to view log timestamps in their preferred timezone:

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai"  // or "local" | "utc" | IANA timezone
  }
}
```

Expected output with `Asia/Shanghai`:
```
2026-01-30T17:01:46.999+08:00 debug agent/embedded ...
```

## Use Case
Users in non-UTC timezones (e.g., China, Asia/Shanghai) find it inconvenient to mentally convert UTC timestamps when debugging.

## Notes
- This could apply to both `openclaw logs` CLI output and the log file itself
- Alternatively, only the CLI display could be converted while keeping file logs in UTC for consistency
