## Description

## Description

Deepgram nova-3 audio transcription intermittently fails to run on inbound Telegram voice notes. When it fails, **no transcript is produced and no log output is generated**, even with `--verbose` enabled. The audio file is always downloaded successfully.

## Reproduction

- Approximately 10-15% of voice notes silently fail to transcribe
- Failures appear random — no pattern tied to message length, timing, or content
- Occurs even when the agent session is idle (not a queue/batching issue)
- The media understanding pipeline appears to silently skip the audio capability for some messages

## What works

- Audio files are always downloaded and saved correctly to `media/inbound/`
- The `[media attached: ... (audio/ogg; codecs=opus) | ...]` note is always generated
- Deepgram API is reachable and responds correctly when called manually via curl
- Successful transcriptions produce the expected `[Audio] User text: ... Transcript: ...` output

## What doesn't work

- On failed messages, the transcription pipeline produces no output at all
- No error, skip, or scope-deny decisions appear in logs
- No entries matching `audio`, `transcri`, `deepgram`, or `media-understanding` appear in the log file for failed messages
- Verbose mode (`--verbose`) does not produce any additional output for failed messages

## Environment

- **Clawdbot:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Platform:** Linux (arm64), Raspberry Pi 4
- **Node:** v25.5.0
- **Channel:** Telegram (polling mode)
- **Audio config:** Deepgram nova-3 with `detect_language`, `punctuate`, `smart_format`
- **Agent model:** Claude (Anthropic)

## Expected behavior

Every inbound audio message should either:
1. Produce a transcript, or
2. Log a clear reason why transcription was skipped or failed

## Actual behavior

Some audio messages silently pass through with no transcription attempt and no log trace.

I'm also experiencing this with groq s a transcription service. It's pretty painful
