## Description

I'd love for clawdbot to be configured in a way for different tasks having different models

say Sonnet/ Opus for Programming
Gemini flash for conversation
GPT 4o/ 4.1 for routine pings/ tasks

will make it more token efficient as well!

BTW yes I've had my clawdbot (moltbot?) set this up for my instance but would be really cool out of the box :)

Might make this a PR in a couple days when uni is a bit more chill but would be happy to gather thoughts / code here

### @chenyuan99 (2026-01-27)

It is a bit tricky right, it would need to verify user has multiple api and auth verfied

### @Kuberwastaken (2026-01-27)

I mean ; would work perfectly well with copilot but it could just pull all places that the user has added APIs for and work that way I presume?
