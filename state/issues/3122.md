## Description

## Problem Statement
Currently, Clawdbot is locked to a single model configuration (defined in `Clawd.json`) for all tasks. Users cannot dynamically offload/replace models without manual intervention (e.g., editing config files and restarting the Gateway). This creates friction when switching between specialized models (e.g., `translategemma` for text extraction + translation, returning to a general-purpose model afterward).

## Use Case
**User Flow:**
1. User sends an image with English text → wants automated OCR + **translation**.
2. Current workflow:
   - Manual switch to `Clawd-translation.json`.
   - Restart Gateway (`clawdbot gateway restart`).
   - Complete task.
3. Desired workflow (intelligent):
   - "Translate this image text" → Clawdbot *automatically* switches to `translategemma`, offloads the previous model, completes the task, and reverts cleanly.

** Workarounds**
**Short-Term:**
- Predefined `Clawd.json` configs per use case (e.g., `Clawd-translation.json`).
- Trigger Gateway restarts via cron or user commands.
  ```bash
  clawdbot gateway restart --config Clawd-translation.json
→ Downsides: Manual, breaks session continuity.

Long-Term:

- Custom agent/sub-agent to monitor tasks and trigger model changes dynamically.
- Example: Detect "translate" keyword → exec(lmstudio models switch) + Gateway reload.

## Proposed Solution

**Short Term (Low Effort)**

- Add a clawdbot config set <model_name> CLI command to toggle models without restarts.
- If not possible, enable session-scoped model overrides in the config file (e.g., Clawd.json supports per-task model overrides).

**Long Term (Native Integration)**

- Skill/Plugin: Design a "Model Swapper" skill that:
        - Listens for task keywords (e.g., "translate," "OCR").
        - Uses LM Studio’s CLI/API to hot-swap models.
        - Restores the previous model automatically after task completion.

- Example API Integration:
        - # Pseudocode: Hypothetical LM Studio Python Client
        - client.switch_model(model_name="translategemma", session_key=<session>)

**Technical Constraints**
Requires LM Studio’s CLI/API to support runtime model changes without Gateway restarts.
Needs Clawdbot to expose model metadata for task-based routing.
