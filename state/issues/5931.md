## Description

## Summary

When using `/session <name>` to switch to a new session in the webchat or TUI, the session does not appear in the session dropdown/picker until a message is actually sent.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open webchat Control UI
2. Run `/session chat1`
3. Run `/session chat2`
4. Open the session dropdown

## Expected

`chat1` and `chat2` should appear in the session list immediately after switching.

## Actual

Only previously-used sessions appear. The new sessions are not visible until you send a message to them.

## Root Cause

`/session <name>` only updates the client-side session key (stored in localStorage for webchat, or in state for TUI). The session entry is not created in `sessions.json` until there's actual activity (message sent/received). The session list (`sessions.list`) is populated from `sessions.json`.

## Suggested Fix

When switching sessions via `/session`, call `sessions.patch` with the session key to ensure it gets created in the store (even if empty). The `sessions.patch` handler already supports creating new sessions:

```js
// In setSession (tui-session-actions.js or webchat equivalent)
await client.patchSession({ key: nextKey });
```

This creates the session entry immediately, making it visible in dropdowns.

## Workaround

Send any message to the session, or manually call `sessions.patch` via the gateway API.
