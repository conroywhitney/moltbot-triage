## Description

### Summary
When receiving Signal messages that contain @mentions, the mention names appear as garbled text or placeholder characters (`\uFFFC`). This is because OpenClaw reads `dataMessage.message` but doesn't process the `dataMessage.mentions` array.

### Expected Behavior
A message like "Hey @Arthur check this" should show the actual name.

### Actual Behavior
The message shows "Hey \uFFFC check this" or garbled characters where the mention should be.

### Signal Message Structure
```json
{
  "message": "Hey \uFFFC check this",
  "mentions": [
    {"start": 4, "length": 1, "uuid": "abc-123", "number": "+1234567890", "name": "Arthur"}
  ]
}
```

### Proposed Fix
In `signal/monitor/event-handler.js`, process the mentions array and replace placeholder characters with the actual names:

```javascript
let messageText = (dataMessage?.message ?? "");
const mentions = dataMessage?.mentions ?? [];
if (mentions.length > 0) {
    const sortedMentions = [...mentions].sort((a, b) => (b.start ?? 0) - (a.start ?? 0));
    for (const mention of sortedMentions) {
        const start = mention.start ?? 0;
        const len = mention.length ?? 1;
        const name = mention.name ?? mention.number ?? mention.uuid ?? "someone";
        const replacement = \`@\${name}\`;
        messageText = messageText.slice(0, start) + replacement + messageText.slice(start + len);
    }
}
messageText = messageText.trim();
```

### Environment
- OpenClaw 2026.2.1
- signal-cli 0.13.23
