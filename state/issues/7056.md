## Description

I think the current Clawdbot architecture is flawed. A correct architecture would place the operational layer at the top, but only allow operations on things like Docker containers or virtual machines.
Has anyone already created a plugin that restricts Clawdbot to only interacting with things inside containers? If not, I'll consider making a similar plugin.
