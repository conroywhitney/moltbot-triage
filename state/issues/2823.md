## Description

Description:
There appears to be a naming inconsistency between the repository name and the name referenced in the README.
Stills says clawdbot instead of moltbot

Actual repository name: moltbot

Name mentioned in README: clawdbot 

I think this is yet to be updated as i see rest updated but still at few places in readme it says clawdbot

Suggested fix:

Update the README to reflect the correct new name moltbot everywhere possible.

Hi @animeshpanara! Good catch. I'd like to take this on and update the README (and any other missed references) to reflect the new moltbot name. Please assign this to me if possible!
