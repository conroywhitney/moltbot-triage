## Description

Description:
There appears to be a naming inconsistency between the repository name and the name referenced in the README.
Stills says clawdbot instead of moltbot

Actual repository name: moltbot

Name mentioned in README: clawdbot 

I think this is yet to be updated as i see rest updated but still at few places in readme it says clawdbot

Suggested fix:

Update the README to reflect the correct new name moltbot everywhere possible.

Hi @animeshpanara! Good catch. I'd like to take this on and update the README (and any other missed references) to reflect the new moltbot name. Please assign this to me if possible!

And also your oneliner which works "everywhere" doesnt work on ubuntu Servers, also moltbot is not working with npm, dudes this is really really really fucked up. I completly like your idea but thats crap(b)
