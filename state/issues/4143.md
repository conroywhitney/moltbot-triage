## Description

## Summary
When using the Kimi 2.5 model, Moltbot sometimes produces a null output and never responds, even after waiting for a long time.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Configure Moltbot to use the Kimi 2.5 model.
2. Send a prompt or message.
3. Occasionally, the model starts processing.
4. Output becomes null and no response is ever returned.

## Expected behavior
The model should either return a valid response or fail gracefully with a clear error.

## Actual behavior
The output is null, and Moltbot stays stuck without responding or throwing an error, even after waiting.

## Environment
- Clawdbot / Moltbot version: Latest Beta release
- OS: macOS (Intel)
- Install method: npm (global install)

## Logs or screenshots
No error logs — request appears to hang and return null output silently.

## Comments

### @spiceoogway (2026-01-30)

I've identified the root cause and submitted a fix in PR #4498.

**TL;DR:** The streaming handler was silently converting null deltas to empty strings, causing the hang.

**The Fix:**
- Detects null/undefined deltas explicitly
- Logs warnings for visibility
- Throws a clear error after 5 consecutive nulls
- Provides actionable feedback ("Try a different model...")

Would appreciate if you could test this once merged!
