## Description

## Environment
- **macOS Version:** 26.2 (Sequoia 15.2, build 25C56)
- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.2.1
- **Node Version:** 22.22.0
- **Install Method:** Homebrew

## Issue
`openclaw gateway install` fails to bootstrap the LaunchAgent on macOS Sequoia 15.2 with error:

```
Bootstrap failed: 125: Domain does not support specified action
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Install OpenClaw 2026.2.1 on macOS Sequoia 15.2
2. Run `openclaw gateway install`
3. Error occurs during `launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`

## Expected Behavior
LaunchAgent should bootstrap successfully and gateway should auto-start on login/reboot.

## Actual Behavior
- Bootstrap fails with error 125
- LaunchAgent plist is created at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`
- `launchctl list | grep openclaw` shows nothing loaded
- `openclaw gateway status` reports "Service: LaunchAgent (not loaded)"
- Gateway requires manual start after each reboot: `openclaw gateway`

## Additional Context
- Error 125 is "Domain does not support specified action" - appears to be a macOS Sequoia LaunchAgent change
- Both `launchctl bootstrap` and legacy `launchctl load` commands fail with similar errors
- The LaunchAgent was working on earlier macOS versions
- Manual gateway start works fine (`openclaw gateway` as foreground process)
- This appears related to how Sequoia handles LaunchAgent domain registration

## System Logs
No relevant errors in Console.app - the launchctl command itself is being rejected by macOS before any plist parsing happens.

## Workaround
Manual start after reboot:
```bash
openclaw gateway
```

## Related
This may be similar to issues other projects have faced with macOS Sequoia's stricter LaunchAgent policies. Consider investigating:
- Alternative LaunchAgent registration methods for Sequoia
- Using `SMAppService` API for service registration (macOS 13+)
- Falling back to user-managed startup for Sequoia until proper fix

## Impact
Gateway does not survive reboots, requiring manual intervention. This breaks the "set it and forget it" deployment model for OpenClaw on Mac Minis / always-on Macs running Sequoia.

thank you for your post mate, i am experiencing the same, I'm on macminim4.
Two things are getting on my nerves at the moment from 26.1.24-3:
1. this gateway thingy;
2. unhandled promise rejection;
