## Description

## Summary

I am experiencing an issue where browser downloads behave differently depending on whether they are triggered manually or via an automated agent.

## Steps to reproduce

• Manual Start: When I trigger a download manually in the browser, the file saves correctly to the Downloads folder as expected.
• Agent Automated: When OpenClaw agent (using browser tool with openclaw profile) attempts to download a file, it often points to a blob:// URL. Other files triggered during the session also start saving as blob: or fail to move to the physical file system properly.
## Expected behavior

all file save to blob://

## Actual behavior

Automated downloads should resolve to physical file paths in the configured Downloads directory, consistent with manual browser behavior.

## Environment

• OS: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0 arm64)
• OpenClaw version: v22.22.0
• Browser Profile: openclaw (isolated)
