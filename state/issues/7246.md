## Description

Hello,
I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out for assistance with an issue I've encountered while using the Google Cloud enterprise edition.
When attempting to use the AI services, I am receiving the following error: 
【LLM error: {
"error": {
"code": 401,
"message": "API keys are not supported by this API. Expected OAuth2 access token or other authentication credentials that assert a principal. See https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication",
"status": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
"details": [
{
"@type": "[type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo](http://type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo)",
"reason": "CREDENTIALS_MISSING",
"domain": "[googleapis.com](http://googleapis.com/)",
"metadata": {
"method": "google.ai.generativelanguage.v1beta.GenerativeService.StreamGenerateContent",
"service": "[generativelanguage.googleapis.com](http://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/)"
}
}
]
}
}】

.
I have configured the authentication using the OAuth 2.0 mode. However, I've noticed that the token expires every hour and requires renewal.
Could you please clarify if the token renewal is something that should be handled automatically by our application, or if there are specific configuration steps I need to implement on my end to ensure seamless, automatic token refresh?
Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your guidance.
