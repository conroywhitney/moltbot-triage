## Description

## Summary

A preparatory phase for digitally hashed and digitally signed brains:  "Cryptographic envelope" that is simply a well defined set of files that are hashed in a specific order.

## Proposed solution

1. Define the key personality files to seal by hash
2. Hash them at startup, and periodically as a system check
3. Add a hook which defines what happens if the hash changes (validation fails) - logging at a minimum, ideally logging to all chat interfaces ("my brain was just replaced")

## Broader implications

This opens the door to versioned persona upgrades, persona upgrade checkpointing and validation, virus and malware detection, and more
