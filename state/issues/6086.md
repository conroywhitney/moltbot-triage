### @Pokem0n2 (2026-02-02)

replace XXXXX with your username:

cd "C:\Users\XXXXX.openclaw"
npm install @m1heng-clawd/feishu
mkdir extensions
mkdir extensions\feishu
xcopy /E /Y "node_modules@m1heng-clawd\feishu*" "extensions\feishu"
cd extensions\feishu
npm install --prod

however, you might meet this (just leave it alone and wait):

npm warn deprecated npmlog@6.0.2: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated are-we-there-yet@3.0.1: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated gauge@4.0.4: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated node-domexception@1.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead

Thanks! But there is a typo, `"node_modules@m1heng-clawd\feishu*"` -> `"node_modules\@m1heng-clawd\feishu\*"`
