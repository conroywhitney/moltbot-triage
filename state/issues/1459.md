## Description

Description:
The message tool with action=react fails to add reactions in Telegram, returning "messageId required" even when messageId is included in the function call parameters. Additionally, using channelId="telegram" results in "Unknown target 'telegram' for Telegram. Hint: <chatId>".

Steps to reproduce:

1. In a Telegram chat, attempt to react to a message using the message tool.
2. Call message with action="react", channel="telegram", target="user_id", emoji="🔥", messageId="message_id".
3. Observe the error.
Expected behavior:
Reaction is added to the specified message.

Actual behavior:
Error: "messageId required" or "Unknown target".

Environment:

• Runtime: agent=main, host=MacBook Pro, os=Darwin 25.2.0 (arm64), node=v22.15.0, model=xai/grok-code-fast-1, channel=telegram
• Clawdbot version: 2026.1.21-2
