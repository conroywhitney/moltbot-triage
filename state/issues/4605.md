## Description

## Summary
I would like to add a `database` capability to openclaw.

openclaw is already very capable for local workflows, but it becomes less effective when users have large external structured datasets and want to do data engineering or data analysis style tasks (large aggregations, reporting, exploratory analysis, persisting intermediate results, etc.). Today those workflows tend to stay in context or files, and there is no first class durable, queryable storage layer the agent can use.

## Proposed solution
Add a minimal end to end capability consisting of a database tool plus a companion skill.

Concretely, this is the shape of the implementation I have already prototyped:

1) A core tool named `tidb` backed by the local `mysql` CLI, so the agent can run SQL for table creation, inserts, queries, aggregations, and exporting results.
2) One token string configuration for connectivity:
   - `TIDB_URL` env var, or `tools.tidb.url` in config (recommended: `tools.tidb.url: "${TIDB_URL}"`).
   - No multi key DB_HOST style configuration.
3) Safe defaults for TiDB Cloud:
   - For `*.tidbcloud.com` hosts, default to `mysql --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`.
4) A companion skill `tidb-sql` to help the model generate TiDB compatible SQL, including common TiDB vs MySQL differences.
5) Tool policy integration:
   - Add a `group:db` tool group to allow or deny database access explicitly.

Questions for maintainers:
- Would you accept this as a core tool, or do you prefer it as a plugin or extension?
- Is the one token string config approach (TIDB_URL) aligned with how you want secrets to be handled?
- What security boundaries do you prefer (default off, allowlists, logging, etc.)?
- How would you like this split into smaller PRs for review (docs and schema, tool wiring, then the skill)?

## Alternatives considered
- Provide only a skill without a tool. This is workable but weak, because the agent cannot actually connect to a DB to run queries or persist results.
- Implement it entirely as a plugin or extension. This isolates dependencies and permissions better, but may be less consistent with the core tool experience.
- Only support importing and exporting datasets (CSV, Parquet). This helps, but still lacks a queryable persistence layer and SQL execution.

## Additional context
- Previous implementation PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/2704
- If you prefer, I can start with a smaller alignment PR that only adds docs, schema, and a minimal skeleton, then iterate in follow up PRs.
