## Description

## Summary
Clawdbot’s Gateway / Control Plane binds to public network interfaces by default and serves dashboard over HTTPs. This makes new installations immediately internet-reachable and discoverable via Shodan, increasing exposure of a high-privilege control surface.For a personal, self-hosted AI assistant, this default behavior creates predictable misdeployment risk, especially for new users.

## Proposed solution
-Bind the Gateway to 127.0.0.1 / ::1 by default
-Require explicit opt-in to expose the control plane on 0.0.0.0 or a public IP
-Enforce first-run admin authentication before serving the UI
-Display a clear warning when public exposure is detected

## Additional context
Multiple publicly reachable Clawdbot Control/Dashboard instances are already indexed shortly after release, indicating common misdeployment patterns rather than isolated cases. No exploitation is claimed here, but this is a secure-by-default improvement request.
