## Description

Currently, openclaw uninstall removes ~/.openclaw entirely, which may contain user workspaces by default.

This leads to irreversible data loss, while the CLI output suggests that workspaces are preserved.

The uninstall command conflates:

runtime state (gateway, services)

user data (workspaces)

This PR separates their lifecycle and makes workspace deletion explicit and opt-in.
