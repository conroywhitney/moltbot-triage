## Description

## Summary
I noticed in the profile/docs that the power-user workflow often involves running 3-6 Claude instances concurrently.

My background is in industrial hardware safety (Vettic), and I specialize in thermal governance. From a hardware physics perspective, sustaining that level of concurrent inference on consumer silicon (Mac Mini/Studio) creates a "Heat Soak" problem. The fan curves on these devices are reactive, meaning they often allow the die to hit 100°C before ramping up, which leads to hard OS-level throttling (kernel_task) that kills performance.

## Proposed solution
I propose exposing a simple `local_thermal_status` endpoint or webhook (e.g., POST /api/thermal/pause).

This would allow external hardware to signal Clawdbot to briefly "pause" or "chill" execution when a physical safety limit is hit.

I’m currently building a hardware interposer (Vettic) that acts as a "Roll Cage" for local agents. It monitors the physical power draw and Thermal Slew Rate (dT/dt) to detect when the silicon is cooking. If Clawdbot exposed this hook, my ESP32 node could signal the agent to throttle gracefully *before* the OS kills the performance.

## Alternatives considered
1. Relying on OS-level throttling (macOS kernel_task): This is non-optimal because it kills system-wide performance and causes UI lag.
2. Reducing instance count: Undesirable. The goal is to run maximum concurrency (3-6 instances) at 100% throttle safely.
3. External fan controllers: These cool the device but don't communicate with the Agent logic to slow down requests.

## Additional context
I am developing the hardware layer (Vettic) to solve this "Always-On" reliability problem. I believe a "Physical/Digital Handshake" is the missing layer for running autonomous agents 24/7 without silicon degradation.

Happy to share the hardware schematics or the "Thermal Slew Rate" logic if this is interesting for the roadmap.

## Comments

### @Vettic-Maker (2026-01-26)

Adding some context from the current log:

I see users are rapidly moving toward multi-agent/sub-agent workflows (e.g., #1903, #2222).

When a main agent spawns multiple sub-agents, the thermal load doesn't just double; it spikes non-linearly. This is where the 'Heat Soak' happens, and why relying on the OS scheduler isn't enough. You need a physical governor to handle that burst without throttling the whole system.

### @Vettic-Maker (2026-01-28)

Context update given the Moltbot rebrand and recent discussions on agentic safety (e.g., the 'Green Box' protocol discussions):

I believe this feature request aligns with the roadmap for a 'Hardened' Moltbot. We are currently developing a hardware-interposer (Vettic) that could serve as the physical enforcement layer for this feature, allowing Moltbot to operate with root-level capabilities without risking the host hardware.

Happy to help scope this out as a 'Safety Integration' if the maintainers are interested in a hardware-backed sandbox approach.
