## Description

## Summary
I have macOS and Linux machines. I want to use Linux as my primary Gateway service with most of my automations. I want to use my macOS to run mac-related apps like notes, reminders etc.

## Proposed solution
A single UI that can access and use multiple Gateway instances with ability to route between the availabe gateways. For instance if I ask to read or write apple related tasks my requests should route to macoOS Gateway, and otherwise to my default Linux Gateway. This ideally should be able to route between multiple available Gateways takeing into account their workload so my requests can rout to the less currently loaded Gateway.

## Alternatives considered
Manually switch between the Gateway instancess.
