## Description

## Feature Request

### Description
Currently, `groupPolicy` and `groupAllowlist` only control **inbound** messages from groups. 

I'd like the ability to restrict **outbound** messages to specific groups as well.

### Use Case
- Security: Prevent the bot from accidentally sending messages to unauthorized groups
- Control: Limit bot responses to specific approved groups only

### Proposed Solution
Add a new config option like:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowlist: ["123456789012345678@g.us"],  // inbound
      groupSendAllowlist: ["123456789012345678@g.us"]  // NEW: outbound
    }
  }
}

Current Workaround

Relying on agent memory/instructions to self-restrict, which is not enforced at the system level.
