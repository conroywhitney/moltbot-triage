## Description

## Summary

I love Claw(d?) but the thing I miss is the Ultrapilot and Autopilot + swarm using oh-my-claude-code it would be nice to see similar functionality in here. 

## Proposed solution

Handle Oh-My-Claude-Code style agents. 

## Alternatives considered

Any other approaches you have considered?
