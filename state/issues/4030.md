## Description

## Summary

When the agent responds with `NO_REPLY`, the gateway could optionally send a reaction emoji to the triggering message instead of doing nothing silently.

## Problem

Currently when the agent decides not to respond (e.g., to simple confirmations like "ok", "thanks"):
1. User sees "typing..." indicator while agent processes
2. Agent returns `NO_REPLY`
3. Nothing happens — user is left wondering if the bot saw their message

## Proposed Solution

Add an optional config to auto-react when `NO_REPLY` is detected:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "noReplyReaction": "👍"
  }
}
```

When set:
- Agent responds `NO_REPLY` → gateway sends the configured emoji reaction to the triggering message
- Empty string or omitted → current behavior (no reaction)

## Benefits

- User gets visual acknowledgment that the bot saw their message
- Reduces confusion from "typing then nothing" UX
- Lightweight — just a reaction, not a full message
- Opt-in — only activates if configured

## Alternatives Considered

- **typingMode: never** — hides typing but still no acknowledgment
- **Always respond** — clutters chat with "👍" text messages
- **Manual react + NO_REPLY** — works but error-prone and verbose for agents

*Tested manually with WhatsApp: react first, then NO_REPLY. Works great! Would love native gateway support.*
