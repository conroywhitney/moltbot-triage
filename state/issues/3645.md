## Description

## Summary

After a compaction fires, a **second compaction immediately triggers** on the already-compacted context — sometimes on as few as 19-39 tokens. This produces a second garbage summary stacked on top of the first, further degrading context recovery.

## Evidence

Timestamp analysis shows two compaction events firing within milliseconds of each other:

| Timestamp | Tokens Before | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Jan 28 17:03:57.328 | 170,085 | — |
| Jan 28 17:03:57.462 | **39** | 134ms |
| Jan 26 06:29:10.817 | 191,248 | — |
| Jan 26 06:29:10.867 | **19** | 50ms |

The second compaction fires on the post-compaction context (39 or 19 tokens) — there's nothing meaningful left to summarize. This is clearly a re-entrant trigger, not an intentional second pass.

## Expected Behavior

After a compaction completes, the system should recognize that context was just compacted and **not** immediately trigger another compaction. There should be either:
1. A debounce/cooldown period after compaction
2. A minimum token threshold that prevents compaction on contexts < N tokens
3. A flag that prevents re-entrant compaction within the same turn

## Actual Behavior

1. Context reaches ~170K-191K tokens
2. First compaction fires (already fails to summarize — see #3643)
3. Post-compaction context is reduced to ~20K tokens (recent messages only)
4. **Immediately** (50-134ms later), a second compaction fires on this already-small context
5. The second compaction also fails to summarize (there's barely anything there)
6. The result is a double-truncated context with two layers of "Summary unavailable" placeholders

## Impact

- Wastes an extra API call attempting to summarize 19-39 tokens
- If summarization actually worked, the second pass would summarize the *summary* rather than original content, losing fidelity
- Combined with #3643 (summarization always failing), this produces double-garbage placeholders
- May indicate a deeper issue with the compaction trigger not properly updating the token count before re-evaluating

## Suggested Fix

Add a guard to prevent re-entrant compaction:

```js
// Option 1: Minimum token threshold
if (preparation.tokensBefore < MIN_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD) {
  return; // Skip — nothing meaningful to compact
}

// Option 2: Cooldown flag
if (session.lastCompactionMs && Date.now() - session.lastCompactionMs < 5000) {
  return; // Skip — just compacted
}
```
