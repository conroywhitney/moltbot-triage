## Description

## Summary

Add support for `—` (em dash) on its own line as an inline context reset separator. This allows users to reset context and start a new session with a follow-up message in a single send.

## Example

```
Do task X
—
Ok now a completely different thing...
```

This would:
1. Process "Do task X" in the current context
2. Reset the session (equivalent to `/new`)
3. Start a new session with "Ok now a completely different thing..." as the first message

## Motivation

- Faster workflow when switching contexts mid-conversation
- No need to send `/new` as a separate message then wait
- More natural for mobile/messaging where splitting messages is friction
- The em dash is visually clean and unlikely to conflict with normal content

## Proposed Behavior

- Trigger: `\n—\n` (em dash on its own line, with newlines before/after)
- Alternative triggers to consider: `\n---\n` (three hyphens) or configurable
- Should work the same as `/new` but pass the remaining text as the first message
- Config option to enable/disable: `commands.emDashReset: true`

## Implementation Notes

Would likely need ~20 lines in the message handler to:
1. Detect the separator pattern before processing
2. Split the message
3. Process first part in current session (if non-empty)
4. Trigger session reset
5. Queue second part as new message

Happy to help with implementation if useful.
