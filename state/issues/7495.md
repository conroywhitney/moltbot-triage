## Description

## Bug Description

When using a cron job with `sessionTarget: isolated` and `payload.kind: agentTurn`, the `to` parameter in the payload is ignored. Messages are delivered to an unintended recipient instead of the specified target.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a cron job with isolated session:
```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Send status update...",
    "deliver": true,
    "channel": "whatsapp",
    "to": "+58x"
  }
}
```

2. Wait for the cron to execute
3. The message is delivered to a different number than specified in `to`

## Expected Behavior

Message should be delivered to the number specified in the `to` field (`+584121195026`).

## Actual Behavior

Message was delivered to `+584241374572` (a completely different, unrelated number - possibly from a cached/previous chat context).

## Impact

**This is a privacy/security issue.** Internal information intended for a specific recipient was sent to an unrelated third party.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: latest (npm global install)
- Channel: WhatsApp
- OS: macOS Darwin 25.2.0 (arm64)
- Node: v22.22.0

## Additional Context

The cron job was a monitoring task for a background process. The isolated session appears to have used some cached or default recipient instead of respecting the explicit `to` parameter in the payload configuration.

The main session correctly routes messages to the right recipient. The issue seems specific to isolated sessions spawned by cron jobs.
