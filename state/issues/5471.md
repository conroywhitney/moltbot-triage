## Description

## Problem

The project has pre-existing oxlint errors that block CI checks for all PRs:
- 2 errors in `src/commands/` (main branch)
- 35+ errors in `extensions/` (GitHub CI checks all directories)

These errors are not caused by new PRs but are blocking them from being merged.

## Error Details

**Type:** typescript-eslint(no-redundant-type-constituents) and other oxlint rules

**Main branch errors (pnpm lint - src + test only):**
- 2 errors in `src/commands/onboard-auth.credentials.ts`
  - `no-base-to-string`: 'creds.email ?? "default"' will use Object's default stringification
  - `restrict-template-expressions`: Invalid type "{}" of template literal expression

**GitHub CI errors (oxlint --type-aware - all directories):**
- 35+ errors in `extensions/` directory

## Reproduction

```bash
# Check main branch errors
git checkout main
pnpm lint

# Check all directories (like GitHub CI does)
pnpm exec oxlint --type-aware
