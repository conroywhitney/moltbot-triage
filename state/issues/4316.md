## Description

## Summary

Some sites (like vercel.com) support serving content as markdown when the `accept: text/markdown` header is present in the request.

## Current Behavior

web_fetch extracts markdown from HTML using content extraction, which works but can be lossy.

## Proposed Behavior

Add `accept: text/markdown` header to web_fetch requests. Sites that support it will return native markdown; those that don't will ignore the header and return HTML as usual.

## Example

```bash
curl -s -H "accept: text/markdown" "https://vercel.com/changelog/tag-based-cache-invalidation-now-available-for-all-responses"
```

Returns clean markdown with proper formatting, metadata, and structure.

## Benefits

- Cleaner output for sites that support it
- No breaking change (header is ignored by non-supporting sites)
- Better than HTML→markdown extraction

## Implementation Notes

Could either:
- Add header by default to all requests
- Make it configurable via a parameter
