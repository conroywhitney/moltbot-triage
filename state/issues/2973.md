## Description

## Problem Summary

When using Talk Mode (voice chat) on the Mac app:
1. User asks for information requiring a tool call (search, API lookup, etc.)
2. Assistant announces it will fetch — this announcement IS voiced
3. Assistant executes the tool call
4. Assistant sends results — this message IS NOT voiced

Expected: All messages in Talk Mode should be voiced consistently.
Actual: Second message after tool execution does not receive audio.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable Talk Mode on Mac app
2. Ask assistant for news/weather requiring a search
3. Assistant says 'Let me search...' (gets voiced)
4. Tool execution occurs
5. Results message (does NOT get voiced)

## Test Case

Command: 'Jarvis tell me about the news today'

Observed:
- 'Let me fetch today's top news for you.' — VOICED
- Tool execution (brave-search)
- 'Gold hit record highs...' — NOT VOICED

## Impact

- Users don't hear search results in Talk Mode
- Announcement-only responses work fine
- Single consolidated messages work fine

## Environment

- MacBook Pro (3)
- App 2026.1.23
- Local mode
- ElevenLabs voice configured

## Workaround

Announcements before tool execution get voiced. Results arrive as text even if not voiced.
