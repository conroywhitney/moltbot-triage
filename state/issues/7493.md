## Description

## Summary
Allow specific group chats to share the same session context as the main/DM session, rather than being isolated.

## Use Case
Trusted group chats (like an exec team chat) where the user wants full context continuity with their DM session. Currently, groups always get isolated sessions (`imessage:group:2`), which means context from DM conversations isn't available in the group and vice versa.

## Proposed Solution
Add a `sessionKey` override option in the channel group config:

```json
"channels": {
  "imessage": {
    "groups": {
      "2": {
        "requireMention": true,
        "sessionKey": "main"  // Route to main session instead of isolated group session
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Workaround
- Semantic memory search across session transcripts (not real-time)
- Shared workspace files (MEMORY.md, daily notes)

## Additional Context
This would be useful for any scenario where a user has a trusted inner circle group that should have the same conversational context as their primary DM session.
