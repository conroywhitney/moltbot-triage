## Description

## Bug

When a session is triggered by a group message and that session is later aborted, the `⚙️ Agent was aborted.` system notification is sent back to the group — even when `sendPolicy` has a deny rule matching that group.

## Config

```json
"sendPolicy": {
  "default": "allow",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "deny",
      "match": {
        "channel": "whatsapp",
        "chatType": "group"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expected Behavior

System notifications (abort, error, etc.) should respect sendPolicy deny rules. If a group is denied, **nothing** should be sent there — not AI replies, not tool outputs, not system notifications.

## Actual Behavior

The `⚙️ Agent was aborted.` notification bypasses the sendPolicy deny rule and gets posted in the WhatsApp group.

## Impact

**Critical for business users.** Monitored groups (e.g., betting outlet groups) are read-only — any outbound message from a linked device is a serious operational risk. This has now happened multiple times (Telegram Atlascope on Jan 30, WhatsApp Prophet on Feb 1).

## Suggested Fix

All reply paths (including system notifications like abort/error/timeout) should pass through the sendPolicy check before delivery. Alternatively, provide a per-group `replyPolicy: never` option that hard-blocks all outbound.
