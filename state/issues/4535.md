## Description

## Summary

Currently, Clawdbot supports various channels, but it lacks integration with the QQ platform, a major instant messaging service in China **with over 600 million monthly active users**.  Users who want to deploy AI bots on QQ using the official API need a standardized channel integration to handle C2C (one-on-one), Group chats, and Guild messages efficiently. Users who want to deploy AI bots on QQ using the official API need a standardized channel integration to handle C2C (one-on-one), Group chats, and Guild messages efficiently.

I have already developed/found a plugin implementation (Moltbot QQ Channel) that handles WebSocket connections, message deduplication, and the specific requirements of the QQ Open Platform.

## Proposed solution
Integrate a new qqbot channel into Clawdbot core or as an officially supported extension.

The implementation should include:

Event Handling: Support for C2C_MESSAGE_CREATE, GROUP_AT_MESSAGE_CREATE, AT_MESSAGE_CREATE (Guild), and DIRECT_MESSAGE_CREATE.
Authentication: Support for AppID and AppSecret configuration.
Connection Management: WebSocket implementation with auto-reconnect and Session Resume.
Message Logic:
Handle msg_seq for message deduplication.
Adhere to QQ's 5-reply limit per message.
Handle URL restrictions in prompts (since QQ blocks most URLs).
Configuration: Allow adding the channel via CLI (clawdbot channels add --channel qqbot).

## Additional context
I previously submitted a PR for this feature, but it was immediately closed with a request to open an issue first. I will resubmit the PR once this issue is approved.

I have a working reference implementation.
