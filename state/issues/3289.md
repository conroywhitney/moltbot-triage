## Description

## Summary
Add white-label customization options for the Control UI dashboard, allowing users to replace the default branding with their own logo, name, and colors.

## Use Case
When deploying Moltbot as a backend for custom products or enterprise solutions, the Control UI should reflect the deployer's brand when accessed by internal users or clients. Currently, the dashboard shows default branding with no way to customize it.

## Proposed Solution
Add configuration options under `gateway.controlUi`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "controlUi": {
      "branding": {
        "name": "My Product",
        "logo": "/path/to/logo.png",
        "favicon": "/path/to/favicon.ico",
        "accentColor": "#5B6DEF",
        "hideFooter": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered
- Forking the repo and modifying the frontend (maintenance burden)
- Reverse proxy CSS injection (hacky, breaks on updates)
- Building a custom dashboard using the API (significant effort)

## Additional Context
This would make Moltbot more attractive for enterprise/white-label deployments where branding consistency is important.
