## Description

## Summary
What went wrong?
When attempting to use the Kimi K2.5 model (`moonshot/kimi-k2.5`) in sub-agents via `sessions_spawn`, the system falls back to using the default model (`qwen-portal/coder-model`) instead of the specified Kimi K2.5 model, despite successful configuration and API connectivity.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Configure Kimi K2.5 model in the configuration with proper credentials
2. Spawn a sub-agent with the explicit model specification: `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`
3. Observe that the returned response comes from the default model instead of Kimi K2.5

## Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen?
The sub-agent should use the specified `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` model for processing requests.

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?
The system ignores the specified model and falls back to using `qwen-portal/coder-model` instead.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.29
- OS: macOS
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): Unknown

## Logs or screenshots
Paste relevant logs or add screenshots (redact secrets).
- Direct API calls to Kimi K2.5 work correctly, confirming the model is accessible and functional
- The issue appears to be related to OpenClaw's model routing mechanism when handling Kimi K2.5
- This may be connected to the known "null deltas" issue with Kimi 2.5 API that was referenced in PR #4498
- The configuration includes the model properly, and it's listed in the available models
