## Description

## Environment
- Platform: Clawdbot on Cloudflare Workers
- R2 Bucket: `moltbot-data` (bound as `MOLTBOT_BUCKET`)
- Durable Object: `moltbot-sandbox_Sandbox` (bound as `Sandbox`)

## Problem
Workspace resets completely on every new session/connection:
- All files in `/root/clawd/` reset to initial templates
- Device registration required every time
- `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `memory/` folder - all lost

## Investigation
1. R2 bucket exists and is properly bound ✓
2. Durable Object exists and is properly bound ✓
3. **R2 bucket is completely empty (0 B)** ← Nothing is being synced

## Expected Behavior
Workspace should persist to R2 between sessions and restore on container startup.

## Actual Behavior
R2 binding exists but no data is ever written. Each Cloudchamber container starts fresh from templates.

## Additional Info
- Same gateway token used across sessions
- `CLOUDFLARE_DURABLE_OBJECT_ID` present in env
- Container host: `cloudchamber`

Does the sandbox image mount the workspace to R2 via s3fs?

It's resolved. Thank you.
