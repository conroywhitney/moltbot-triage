## Description

# My OpenClaw logs consistently show the error message: "msg rpc: failed to parse permissionDenied(path: "/Users/zhangpengtao/Library/Messages/chat.db", underlying: authorization denied (code: 23)): Unexpected token 'p', "permission"... is not valid JSON".

## RPC should be used to send information, not to receive information.

## Environment
2026.1.29
Mac OS 26.2
pnpm、npm、npx、curl
