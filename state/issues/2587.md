## Description

## Summary
When a message arrives, it would be helpful to send a quick acknowledgment (e.g., "Got it, working on this...") **before** the agent starts processing.

## Use case
On slower models (Opus) or complex tasks, users see nothing for 10-30+ seconds. A quick ack makes the experience feel more responsive, especially on platforms like **Microsoft Teams** where bot reactions aren't supported.

## Current state
- `messages.ackReaction` works great on WhatsApp, Discord, Slack (emoji reaction)
- Teams doesn't support bot-initiated reactions
- No way to send a text ack before agent processing begins

## Proposed solution
Add a `message:inbound` hook event that fires immediately when a message is received, before it's queued for agent processing. This would allow:
- Sending a configurable ack message
- Platform-specific handling (reactions where supported, text fallback elsewhere)

## Config idea
```json
{
  "messages": {
    "ackMessage": {
      "enabled": true,
      "text": "Got it, working on this...",
      "fallbackText": true,
      "scope": "all"
    }
  }
}
```

Or alternatively, expose it as an internal hook event (`message:inbound`) so users can write custom handlers.

## Alternatives considered
- Typing indicators (Teams supports these, but they're less explicit)
- Faster models (helps but doesn't solve the UX gap)

Thanks for considering! 🏀
