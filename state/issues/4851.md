## Description

## Summary
The Ansible link in the documentation leads to a 404, and the clawdbot-ansible repo seems out of date.  

## Steps to reproduce
1. Navigate to Open Claw site
2. Click on Docs
3. Click on Ansible under the side menu under Install & Updates
4. Click on link Full guide: [github.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible) The openclaw-ansible repo is the source of truth for Ansible deployment. This page is a quick overview.
5. See 404
6. Navigate to Open Claw org
7. Look for open claw ansible
8. Doesn't exist, only clawdbot-ansible using the old cli

## Expected behavior
The full guide should take you directly to an open claw repo that has the full guide wit the new cli, especially since this is the recommended production installation path

## Actual behavior
End up on 404 page
