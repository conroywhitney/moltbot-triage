## Description

## Summary
The current `install.sh` requires Homebrew to install Node.js. For people that installed Node another way and can't use Homebrew, there should be an alternative. Some people are not allowed to use Homebrew on work computers, for instance.

## Proposed solution
What would you like Clawdbot to do?

Currently, the `install.sh` first checks for Homebrew and then installs it if missing. Then it installs Node.js via Homebrew.

I propose to instead first check if Node is installed. Only if it is not installed, check for Homebrew and then install Node.js.

## Alternatives considered
Node.js alternative installation via NVM or MacPorts, if available, could also be checked if Homebrew is absent.
