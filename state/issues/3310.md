## Description

## Summary
The current `install.sh` requires Homebrew to install Node.js. For people that installed Node another way and can't use Homebrew, there should be an alternative. Some people are not allowed to use Homebrew on work computers, for instance.

## Proposed solution
What would you like Clawdbot to do?

Currently, the `install.sh` first checks for Homebrew and then installs it if missing. Then it installs Node.js via Homebrew.

I propose to instead first check if Node is installed. Only if it is not installed, check for Homebrew and then install Node.js.

## Alternatives considered
Node.js alternative installation via NVM or MacPorts, if available, could also be checked if Homebrew is absent.

Potential workaround: install brew in the the users home folder. It works for me on my Mac Studio home server for non-admin account.

```
# Clone Homebrew to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew ~/.homebrew

# Add to your shell config (~/.zshrc)
echo 'eval "$(~/.homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Load it now
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify it works
brew --version
```

I then installed node via nvm:

```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.4/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install --lts
$ node --version

$openclaw@mac-1 ~ % node --version
v24.13.0
```

The command line again to install:

```
$ openclaw@mac-1 ~ % curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

  🦞 OpenClaw Installer
  I'll do the boring stuff while you dramatically stare at the logs like it's cinema.

✓ Detected: macos
✓ Homebrew already installed
✓ Node.js v24.13.0 found
✓ Git already installed
→ Installing OpenClaw 2026.1.29...
✓ OpenClaw installed

🦞 OpenClaw installed successfully (2026.1.29)!
Finally unpacked. Now point me at your problems.

Starting setup...

Thanks for the suggestion @dirkpostma . I just commented out the Homebrew part in the `install.sh`, that worked for me, personally, too.
