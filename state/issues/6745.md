## Description

## Summary

What went wrong?
When the google workspace is configured all the different google products work (gmail,calendar,etc...) except the google Tasks feature (which is part of the calendar - because you can create three possible items : event,meeting or task) 

## Steps to reproduce

1. Configure default google skill and authenticate
2. Ask openclaw to create a task (that's what we mostly excpect from an assistant - the ability to manage our daily tasks, week and month overview.
3.Clawbot can't create or view the tasks within the calendar

## Expected behavior
I would expect the google workspace skill to not only recognise the meetings but also the tasks and events), but it only can manage meetings.

What did you expect to happen?
Ability to manage google tasks

## Actual behavior
Refusal


## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026-01-29
- OS: Ubuntu
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): default clawbot skill installer)
