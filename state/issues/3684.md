## Description

## Summary
  Users in China Mainland face significant barriers accessing international messaging platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp,    
  Discord) due to network restrictions (GFW). This prevents a large potential user base from using Moltbot as their AI  
  assistant gateway.

  QQ is one of China's largest messaging platforms (Tencent, 600M+ active users), freely accessible without
  restrictions. Adding QQ support would enable Chinese users to use Moltbot through their most commonly used messaging  
  app.

## Proposed solution
Add QQ as a new channel in Moltbot using the OneBot v11 protocol:

  - Protocol: OneBot v11 (standard bot protocol for QQ ecosystem)
  - Backend: https://github.com/NapNeko/NapCatQQ (actively maintained OneBot implementation)
  - Communication: WebSocket (forward connection)
  - Structure: Extension under extensions/qq/
  
  Features:
  - Private message (DM) support
  - Group message support
  - Media message handling (images, files)
  - Multi-account support
  - DM policy (pairing/allowlist/open)
  - Onboarding wizard integration

  I have a working implementation ready and can break it into smaller PRs for easier review:
  1. OneBot client and protocol types
  2. Account management and config schema
  3. Message sending/receiving
  4. Channel plugin integration
## Alternatives considered
  1. Other QQ bot frameworks (e.g., go-cqhttp) - NapCatQQ is more actively maintained and has better compatibility with 
  latest QQ versions
  2. HTTP API instead of WebSocket - WebSocket provides real-time bidirectional communication, better suited for chat   
  applications
  3. WeChat support - WeChat has stricter bot restrictions; QQ's OneBot ecosystem is more mature and bot-friendly

感谢大佬！

### @WEP-56 (2026-01-29)

支持

### @GoForceX (2026-01-29)

Definitely need this.

Onebot is a widely used bot protocol in China. And there are many Onebot-compatible open source adapters for social media in China.

我们也在做一个 molbot中文版：https://github.com/CrayBotAGI/Craybot
现在头疼分支管理和自动依赖的事情
有兴趣的朋友们可以来玩一下，QQ扫码
