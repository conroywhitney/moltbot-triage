## Description

## Summary

The macOS app cannot read/review iMessages even when Full Disk Access has been granted in System Settings.

## Current behavior

- Full Disk Access is enabled for the Clawdbot macOS app
- App still cannot access the iMessage database (`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`)
- Unable to read or review iMessage history

## Expected behavior

With Full Disk Access granted, the app should be able to read the iMessage database for features like:
- Reviewing message history
- Searching conversations
- Integration with the `imsg` skill

## Environment

- macOS version: 26.2.0 (based on user report)
- Clawdbot app: latest

## Notes

This may be related to:
- App sandboxing restrictions
- Hardened runtime entitlements
- The specific FDA entitlement needed for Messages access
- Possible need for the app to be signed with specific entitlements for Messages database access

## Workaround

CLI tools like `imsg` may work if run directly from Terminal (which has FDA), but the app integration does not.

## Comments

### @yanda (2026-01-26)

## Additional context

Important clarification: this issue is specific to the **Clawdbot.app** (macOS client), not the gateway service.

We built a custom **ClawdbotGateway.app** wrapper that launches the gateway, and FDA works correctly with it — iMessages are fully accessible via the `imsg` skill.

**Working setup (ClawdbotGateway.app):**
- Simple wrapper that uses `/usr/bin/open` to launch
- Runs node from mise (`~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/25.4.0/bin/node`)
- FDA granted to the app flows through to subprocesses
- iMessages readable ✓

**Non-working setup (Clawdbot.app macOS client):**
- FDA granted in System Settings
- Still cannot access iMessage database
- iMessages not readable ✗

This suggests something specific about how Clawdbot.app is built or configured — possibly:
- App Sandbox enabled (overrides FDA)
- Missing entitlements for file access
- Hardened runtime restrictions

The fact that a simple app wrapper with FDA works fine, but the official macOS app doesn't, should help narrow down the cause.

@yanda I found imsg works fine when I run openclaw gateway in the term(term app has given full disk access permission). But when I run openclaw gateway install, imsg rpc not ready (Error: imsg rpc exited (code 1)) error occurs.

### @pypandas (2026-02-01)

Sadly, it doesn't work in new version openclaw. filepath and filename have been changed. Look forward new solution.
