## Description

## Bug: `browser act` fails with "tab not found" while other browser commands work

### Summary
The `browser act` command (`click`, `type`, `evaluate`, `hover`, etc.) consistently fails with a `"tab not found"` error, even though the browser service is running, CDP is reachable, and other browser commands work correctly on the same tab.

This appears to be a CDP target/session lifecycle issue specific to `browser act`.

### Browser Status
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "profile": "openclaw",
  "running": true,
  "cdpReady": true,
  "cdpHttp": true,
  "pid": 29127,
  "cdpPort": 18800,
  "cdpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:18800",

  "tabs": [
    {
      "targetId": "053E32F4026A225D1F5E471BBF30538C",

    }
  ]
}

### Command Behavior

### Command | Result
-- | --
browser navigate | ✅ Works
browser snapshot | ✅ Works
browser screenshot | ✅ Works
browser status | ✅ Works
browser tabs | ✅ Works
browser focus | ✅ Works
browser act click | ❌ Fails (tab not found)
browser act type | ❌ Fails
browser act evaluate | ❌ Fails

### Reproduction Steps

1. Start OpenClaw gateway

2. Run browser navigate to any URL

3. Run browser snapshot (succeeds)

4. Run browser act evaluate "document.title"

5. Observe "tab not found" error

### Observed Pattern

The issue is intermittent / spotty

Sometimes browser act works briefly after a fresh gateway + browser start

It often fails after:

tab backgrounding

page navigation

Chrome session restore

Restarting the gateway temporarily resolves the issue

### Analysis

Stateless CDP operations (snapshot, screenshot) work reliably

Stateful interaction commands (act) fail, suggesting:

lost or invalidated CDP target/session

cached targetId or sessionId no longer valid

The tab remains visible and listed via Target.getTargets, but act cannot attach

This suggests missing or fragile handling of:

target reattachment

session persistence

target recreation events

### Expected Behavior

browser act should:

re-resolve or reattach to the active page target when needed

gracefully recover if a target/session was dropped but the tab still exists

not fail with "tab not found" when the tab is clearly present and accessible

### Notes

This does not appear to be a configuration issue:

CDP is reachable

WebSocket URLs are valid

Other browser commands operate on the same tab successfully
