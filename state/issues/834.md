## Description

## Summary

I had previously configured Clawd with Telegram as I did not have a second WhatsApp number. I might have still tried pairing with my WhatsApp though, I remember a QR sync through terminal that never properly finished.

I had stopped the clawdbot daemon for the last few days. 

I restarted my Mac and it mass messaged the following message to almost 20 of my WhatsApp contacts. (maybe it tried sending everyone, but Whatsapp rate limited the bot?)

Here is the message it sent to my contacts:

```
Clawdbot: access not configured.

Pairing code: 24K923HX

Ask the bot owner to approve with:
clawdbot pairing approve --provider whatsapp <code>
```

## Steps to reproduce
- Not sure.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.8-2
- OS: Sequoia 15.7.3
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): pnpm

This bug was quite concerning and embarrassing, so I had to remove clawdbot from my system. Going to try in a VM without Whatsapp access in the future.

Same 1 hour ago.. I'm stuck!

Rather, it's a promiscuous feature.

You can ask it to switch to allowlist mode, which silently ignores non-allowed numbers (no response at all).

What does it mean tho? Kinda scared my friend has access to my whatsapp actually. Her bot sent me a message on WhatsApp mentioning my own mobile number including a pairing code which i sent to her. Can she use it in any bad way? Did i just give her access to my whatsapp or phone with that pairing code her bot gave me after i talk to her bot??????
