## Description

## Summary

I had previously configured Clawd with Telegram as I did not have a second WhatsApp number. I might have still tried pairing with my WhatsApp though, I remember a QR sync through terminal that never properly finished.

I had stopped the clawdbot daemon for the last few days. 

I restarted my Mac and it mass messaged the following message to almost 20 of my WhatsApp contacts. (maybe it tried sending everyone, but Whatsapp rate limited the bot?)

Here is the message it sent to my contacts:

```
Clawdbot: access not configured.

Pairing code: 24K923HX

Ask the bot owner to approve with:
clawdbot pairing approve --provider whatsapp <code>
```

## Steps to reproduce
- Not sure.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.8-2
- OS: Sequoia 15.7.3
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): pnpm

This bug was quite concerning and embarrassing, so I had to remove clawdbot from my system. Going to try in a VM without Whatsapp access in the future.

### @test-n-prod (2026-01-27)

also happened to me but it only sends this message as a reply to any incoming DMs i get

Same 1 hour ago.. I'm stuck!

### @zaccheah (2026-01-27)

Rather, it's a promiscuous feature.

You can ask it to switch to allowlist mode, which silently ignores non-allowed numbers (no response at all).

What does it mean tho? Kinda scared my friend has access to my whatsapp actually. Her bot sent me a message on WhatsApp mentioning my own mobile number including a pairing code which i sent to her. Can she use it in any bad way? Did i just give her access to my whatsapp or phone with that pairing code her bot gave me after i talk to her bot??????

What is the reason it sends that code? What it does?

## 🚨 Don't Panic: You haven't been hacked.

First, take a deep breath. Your friends **do not** have access to your server or WhatsApp.

The "pairing code" the bot sent them is just a **connection request**. It is useless unless **YOU** (the owner) manually type that code into your own computer terminal to approve it. Unless you type that code, they can't do anything.

---

## 🛠️ How to Fix It (Stop the Spam)

The bot is doing this because, by default, it is in `Open/Pairing Mode`. It thinks every new message is a potential owner trying to connect, so it sends a code to everyone.

**To stop the mass messaging immediately:**

1. Open your config file: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`
2. Find the `dmPolicy` line and change it from `pairing` to `allowlist`.

```json
// Change this line:
"dmPolicy": "pairing"

// To this:
"dmPolicy": "allowlist"
```

3. **Restart the bot.**

### What does this change do?
Now, the bot will check if the phone number is in your `allowed list` first.

* ❌ **Friend/Stranger:** Bot stays silent. (No spam, no codes).
* ✅ **You (Allowed Number):** Bot replies normally.

> [!WARNING]
> ### ⚠️ The One Security Risk: "Social Engineering"
> Even though it's not a technical hack, there is a "people trick" you need to watch out for. Since your friend (or a stranger) has a code, they might message you saying:
>
> *"Hey, your bot told me to tell you this code to fix it!"*
>
> **Do not listen to them.** Never, ever type a pairing approve command with a code you didn't ask for yourself. If you simply ignore the code, you are 100% safe. By switching to `allowlist` mode mentioned above, you stop these codes from even being generated.
