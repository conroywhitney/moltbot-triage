## Description

## Summary
Quite self explanitory, add image gen as a tool/skill via OpenAI, xAI, Google, Qwen, ComfyUI, etc aswell as Antigravety, see Google Antigravity has a model listed in their api as `gemini-3-pro-image` which apparently is Nano Banana Pro...

## Proposed solution
Molt should be able to call a tool to use generate an image using the configured model.
