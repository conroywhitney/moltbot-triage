## Description

## Summary
What went wrong?
I’m not able to change the model during an active session. When selecting a different model, the session stays on the previous one and returns an error.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run /model or /models inside an active session
2. Select openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini
3. Receive the error message:
model set failed: Error: model not allowed: openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini

## Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen? 
The session model should change to the selected model.

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?
The session remains on the same model.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: ubuntu-24.04
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npx

## Logs or screenshots
Paste relevant logs or add screenshots (redact secrets).

2. However, I was able to set the desired model as the default model.

UPDATE: 

1. Looks like while the model is from the same provider I needed to auth again in order of using gpt-5.1-codex-mini
2. To do so I did the whole 'clawdbot onboard' flow again and managed to auth again for openai
3. This steps solved my problem to change the session model, but I think is kind of unnecessary.

If someone know a better approach please let me know

same issue, address by 'clawdbot onboard' again. I wish this could be fixed later.
