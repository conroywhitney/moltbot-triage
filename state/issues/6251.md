## Description

## Summary

Several directories under `~/.openclaw/` are created with mode `755` (world-readable) instead of `700` (owner-only). While the parent `~/.openclaw/` directory is correctly set to `700`, the internal directories containing sensitive data inherit the default umask.

## Affected Directories

Observed on fresh install:
- `~/.openclaw/identity/` — contains `device.json` with **private keys**
- `~/.openclaw/cron/`
- `~/.openclaw/devices/`
- `~/.openclaw/logs/`
- `~/.openclaw/memory/`
- `~/.openclaw/canvas/`

## Current State

```
drwx------  ~/.openclaw/              (700) ✓
drwxr-xr-x  ~/.openclaw/identity/     (755) ← should be 700
drwxr-xr-x  ~/.openclaw/cron/         (755) ← should be 700
-rw-------  ~/.openclaw/identity/device.json (600) ✓
```

The files themselves have correct permissions, but the directories are unnecessarily open.

## Risk

Low severity due to parent directory protection, but defense-in-depth suggests these should be locked down:
- If parent directory permissions are ever loosened (e.g., for shared access to workspace), sensitive directories would be exposed
- Principle of least privilege

## Suggested Fix

When creating directories, explicitly set mode `0700` for sensitive paths:

```javascript
fs.mkdirSync(path, { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 });
```

Or apply restrictive permissions immediately after creation.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: latest (installed via npm)
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)
- Default umask: 022
