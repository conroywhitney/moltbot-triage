## Description

## Summary
`clawdbot cron list` crashes with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'padEnd')
```

## Root Cause
In `dist/cli/cron-cli/shared.js`, the `printCronList` function references `job.id`:
```javascript
const idLabel = pad(job.id, CRON_ID_PAD);
```

But the job object returned from the Gateway uses `jobId`, not `id`. So `job.id` is `undefined`, and calling `.padEnd()` on it throws.

## Fix
Change:
```javascript
const idLabel = pad(job.id, CRON_ID_PAD);
```
To:
```javascript
const idLabel = pad(job.jobId ?? job.id ?? "", CRON_ID_PAD);
```

This handles both `jobId` (canonical) and `id` (legacy compatibility) as documented.

## Version
```
Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3 (885167d)
```

## Workaround
Manually patch the local file at `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/dist/cli/cron-cli/shared.js`
