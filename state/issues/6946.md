## Description

## Summary

Add a "processing indicator" feature that sends a visible message (e.g., ⌛️) when a message is received and being processed, then deletes it when the reply is sent.

## Motivation

Current feedback mechanisms:
- **Typing indicators** ("typing...") - subtle, easy to miss
- **Ack reactions** - adds emoji to the received message
- **Draft streaming** - only works in DMs with forums enabled

None of these clearly indicate "I received your message and am working on it" in a highly visible way, especially in group chats.

## Proposed Behavior

```
User sends message → Bot sends ⌛️ immediately → Bot processes → Bot deletes ⌛️ → Bot sends reply
```

If processing fails (e.g., Gateway disconnect):
```
User sends message → Bot sends ⌛️ → Error occurs → Bot edits ⌛️ to show error code/message
```

## Suggested Configuration

```json5
{
  messages: {
    processingIndicator: {
      enabled: true,
      emoji: "⌛️",  // or custom message
      deleteOnReply: true,
      showErrorOnFailure: true,
    }
  }
}
```

Or per-channel:
```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      processingIndicator: "⌛️"
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- The infrastructure exists: `sendMessageTelegram` and `deleteMessageTelegram` are already implemented
- Would need to hook into the message dispatch flow in `bot-message-dispatch.js`
- Store the sent message ID and delete it in the delivery callback

- Existing `ackReaction` feature (similar concept but uses reactions)
- `typingMode` config (controls typing indicators)
