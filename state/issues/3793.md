## Description

## Summary
After I created a Telegram bot and then clicked the link to open a chat with it, I saw a message with my user ID, a pairing code, and instructions to run `moltbot pairing approve telegram <code>`

## Expected behavior
I expected that would approve the request and I would be able to communicate with moltbot via Telegram on cellphone.

## Actual behavior
I got an error: Failed to start CLI: Error: Channel telegram does not support pairing

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.27-beta.1
- OS: MacOS Tahoe 26.2
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npm

@rahimnathwani did you compare your Telegram ID with the ID the bot sent?

### @rahimnathwani (2026-01-29)

The ID was a number. The pairing code was a set of capital letters. I don't know where to see if the number matches my Telegram ID.

### @minhnq-nws (2026-01-29)

@rahimnathwani let's use this bot to compare: https://t.me/myidbot

Also, you can add your Telegram ID in the web config.

### @rahimnathwani (2026-01-29)

Yes it's the same ID.

### @minhnq-nws (2026-01-29)

@rahimnathwani have you tried to set up from there:

Thanks. I just did that and I can now message Moltbot from Telegram.

Thanks!
