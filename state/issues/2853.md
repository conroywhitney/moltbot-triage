## Description

## Summary
All cron jobs using `sessionTarget: "isolated"` with `payload.kind: "agentTurn"` fail immediately with a JavaScript TypeError after upgrading from 2026.1.21 to 2026.1.24-3.

## Environment
- **Broken version**: 2026.1.24-3
- **Working version**: 2026.1.21
- **Model**: Custom provider `minimax-local` using `openai-completions` API
- **Platform**: Linux

## Reproduction Steps
1. Configure a cron job with `sessionTarget: "isolated"` and `payload.kind: "agentTurn"`
2. Run the job manually (`clawdbot cron run <id> --force`) or wait for scheduled trigger
3. Check run log in `~/.clawdbot/cron/runs/<job-id>.jsonl`

## Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: Agent executes, produces output, delivers message
- **Actual**: Job completes with `status: "ok"` but summary contains error message, very short duration

## Error Details
Run log shows:
```json
{"status":"ok","summary":"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')","durationMs":98}
```

Same job in v2026.1.21 works correctly:
```json
{"status":"ok","summary":"Good morning! Based on your Whoop data...","durationMs":20333}
```

## Model Configuration
```json
{
  "minimax-local": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8082/v1",
    "apiKey": "lm-studio",
    "api": "openai-completions",
    "models": [{
      "id": "MiniMax-M2.1",
      "input": ["text"]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Potential Bug Locations
Based on code analysis, likely candidates:
- `dist/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.js:91` (profileOrder.includes check)
- `dist/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.js:146` (model.input?.includes check)
- New `transcript-policy.js` logic added in 2026.1.24-3

## Workaround
Downgrade to 2026.1.21: `pnpm add clawdbot@2026.1.21`
