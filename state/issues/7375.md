## Description

### Summary

The built-in `image` tool is failing on all incoming PNG images in my OpenClaw setup with the error:

> Failed to optimize image

This affects images sent via Slack; the agent can see the file paths but cannot load or process them.

---

### Environment

- OpenClaw version: `2026.2.1`
- Install mode: `npm i -g openclaw@latest`
- OS: Ubuntu on 2017 iMac (Intel)
- Channel: Slack
- Agent: `agent=main`, model `openai-codex/gpt-5.1`
- Gateway: running interactively in a terminal

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start the OpenClaw gateway (interactive terminal).
2. Send a PNG image to the assistant via Slack (e.g., #openclaw-chat).
3. Ask the agent to analyze or summarize the image contents.

Example images tested:

- `/home/sporter/.openclaw/media/inbound/3f82dbb1-0fad-4eda-91c4-49810b5612a5.png`
- `/home/sporter/.openclaw/media/inbound/f60177cb-a9a1-4308-a63d-1cc662ac4b70.png`
- `/home/sporter/.openclaw/media/inbound/08e182ec-e75b-4f5b-a429-daf89b219617.png`

---

### Expected Behavior

The agent should be able to load the PNGs, run the `image` tool, and return extracted text/summary from the image.

---

### Actual Behavior

The agent reports that the image tool failed with a generic "Failed to optimize image" error. From the gateway logs:

2026-02-02T19:11:32.073Z error [tools] image failed: Failed to optimize image
No additional error information is emitted (e.g., missing binary or library name), so it’s hard to tell whether this is a missing dependency, config issue, or a bug in the image tool itself.





Additional Notes

• This behavior persisted before and after updating from 2026.1.30 to 2026.2.1 via openclaw update.
• openclaw doctor did not report any specific image-related issues; it just recommended running openclaw update.
• The Slack media path is clearly visible to the agent and the files exist on disk; only the optimization step fails.
If you’d like, I can run additional diagnostics or install any suggested image/graphics libraries and report back.
