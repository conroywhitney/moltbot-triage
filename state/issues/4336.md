## Description

## Bug Description

Signal's `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` with `groupAllowFrom` doesn't work as expected. Users expect to put **group IDs** in `groupAllowFrom` to allow specific groups, but the code actually checks for **sender phone numbers/UUIDs** in that list.

## Current Behavior

When configured like this:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groupAllowFrom": ["my-family-chat-group-id"]
    }
  }
}
```

Messages from the group are blocked because `groupAllowFrom` is checked against the sender's phone number/UUID, not the group ID. The only workaround is setting `groupPolicy: "open"`, which allows ALL groups.

## Expected Behavior

There should be a way to allow specific Signal groups by group ID, similar to how Telegram supports `channels.telegram.groups.<groupId>`.

## Root Cause

In `src/signal/monitor/event-handler.ts`, the `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` check uses `isSignalSenderAllowed(sender, effectiveGroupAllow)` which matches against phone numbers/UUIDs, not group IDs.

Signal was missing the `groups` config mechanism that Telegram and iMessage have via `resolveChannelGroupPolicy()`.
