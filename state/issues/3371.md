## Description

## Feature Request

It would be useful to have an option to mirror/duplicate agent replies to multiple channels simultaneously.

**Use case:**
- User has both WebChat and Telegram connected
- When the user sends a message from either channel, they want to see the agent's reply in **both** channels
- This allows them to continue the conversation from any device/channel without missing context

**Current behavior:**
- Reply only goes to the channel where the message originated

**Proposed behavior:**
Add a config option like:
```json5
{
  messages: {
    mirrorReplies: ["webchat", "telegram"]
    // or
    replyToAllChannels: true
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless multi-device experience
- Never miss a reply regardless of which device you're on
- Conversation history synced across channels

**Potential concerns:**
- Duplicate notifications (could be optional/configurable)
- May need rate limiting to prevent spam
