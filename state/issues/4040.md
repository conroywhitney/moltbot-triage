## Description

### Problem
When receiving a long voice message (4+ minutes), the user sees no feedback while:

1. Audio is downloaded
2. Transcription runs (can take 1-3+ minutes for long messages)
3. Agent processes the text
4. Response is generated

This creates poor UX - user doesn't know if the message was received or if the bot is stuck.

**Proposed Solution**

Add a config option like:
```
{
  "messages": {
    "transcriptionAck": {
      "enabled": true,
      "text": "🎙️ Voice received, transcribing...",
      "minDurationSec": 30
    }
  }
}
```
Or channel-specific with reaction option:
```
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "transcriptionAck": {
        "enabled": true,
        "reaction": "👂"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Alternatives Considered
Using a hook (doesn't work - transcription happens before agent invocation)
Typing indicator (already happens, but insufficient for multi-minute waits)
Context
User reported waiting 4+ minutes with no feedback while their voice message was being processed. A simple acknowledgment would significantly improve the experience.
