## Description

## Severity: Medium

## Description
No explicit CORS headers are configured in the HTTP server implementation, which may allow unauthorized cross-origin requests.

## Location
- `src/gateway/server-http.ts`

## Risk
- Unauthorized websites could make API requests on behalf of authenticated users
- Potential for CSRF-like attacks

## Recommendation
- Implement explicit CORS policy with appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
- Use a strict allowlist for permitted origins
- Configure CORS for all HTTP endpoints
