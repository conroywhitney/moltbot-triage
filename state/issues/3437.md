## Description

## Summary
GitHub Copilot works perfectly as a model provider in Clawdbot, but it's **not available during the initial onboarding wizard**. Users have to discover and add it manually after setup.

## Current Behavior
The onboarding wizard (`clawdbot onboard`) offers these auth options:
- Anthropic API key/OAuth  
- OpenAI API key/OAuth
- OpenCode Zen, Vercel AI Gateway
- MiniMax, Moonshot, Synthetic
- Various other providers

**Missing:** GitHub Copilot

## Expected Behavior  
GitHub Copilot should be listed as an option during `clawdbot onboard` alongside other providers.

## Current Workaround
1. Complete onboarding with Anthropic/OpenAI/etc
2. Later run: `clawdbot models auth login-github-copilot` 
3. Manually switch models to use GitHub billing

## Impact
- Developers with GitHub Copilot subscriptions can't use their existing billing from day one
- Creates friction - users have to discover the workaround
- Inconsistent with other provider offerings in the wizard

## Technical Notes
- The provider works perfectly (tested and confirmed)
- Device login flow exists: `clawdbot models auth login-github-copilot`
- Documentation exists: `/providers/github-copilot.md`
- Just needs wizard integration

## Value
Makes setup smoother for developers already paying for GitHub Copilot subscriptions.
