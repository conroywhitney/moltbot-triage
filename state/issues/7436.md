## Description

## Problem

The browser control service (Chrome CDP on port 18800) crashes silently and OpenClaw doesn't detect it, causing webchat to fail without clear error messages.

## Observed Behavior

1. Browser service crashes at some point after gateway startup
2. `browser action=status` still reports `running: true` even though the process is dead
3. Port 18800 stops responding (`curl http://127.0.0.1:18800/json/version` fails)
4. Webchat fails silently - no responses to messages
5. Canvas test page (`/__openclaw__/canvas/`) shows "Bridge: missing"

## Timeline (from logs)

```
20:07:30 - Browser control service ready (after gateway restart)
20:07:42 - Webchat connections successful
20:14:49 - Browser service restarted (why?)
20:15-20:17 - WhatsApp working fine
20:18:54 - Webchat messages not triggering agent runs (11 min gap)
```

## Workaround

Manual restart fixes it:
```bash
# browser action=stop
# browser action=start
```

## Expected Behavior

1. Detect when browser process dies
2. Auto-restart browser service when it crashes
3. Show clear error in webchat when bridge is unavailable
4. Fix canvas test page or remove it

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.2.1
- macOS 15.7.3
- Chrome 144.0.7559.110
- gateway.mode: local, bind: loopback
