## Description

## Summary
What went wrong?
https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg  <--  This is hardcoded in the app.  It's well known that .svg files can contain malicious code in them.  This file absolutely should not be hardcoded as a web asset to some unknown CDN that could be comprimised.

## Steps to reproduce
1.  Install and build from source
2.  Fire up the Gateway
3.  Observe the link to the image being a remote SVG file.

## Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen?
It should load a local version of the SVG file. Where it can be replaced with a TRUSTED image file.

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?
It loaded an untrusted remote resource.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: main
- OS: Linux
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc):
pnpm

I'm joining in on this issue, hoping that it's related : the SVG icon no longer loads at all and simply returns an invalid signature error now.
403 - sig_invalid
