## Description

### Summary

When a cron job running in an **isolated session** (`sessionTarget: "isolated"`) spawns a sub-agent via `sessions_spawn`, the gateway process restarts approximately 1 minute later, causing the pending sub-agent work to be lost.

### Environment

- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **OS:** Linux 6.14.0-37-generic (Ubuntu, x64)
- **Node:** v22.22.0
- **Install method:** npm (global)

### Timeline (from logs)

```
2026-01-27 03:00:00 EST  Cron job fires (sessionTarget: isolated)
2026-01-27 03:00:15 EST  sessions_spawn returns status: accepted
                         childSessionKey: agent:main:subagent:fc98a01d-...
2026-01-27 03:00:23 EST  Isolated session completes
2026-01-27 03:01:08 EST  Gateway process restarts (new PID)
```

**Result:** Sub-agent session was never created. No session file exists.

### Evidence

1. No system reboot at that time
2. No OOM kill in dmesg  
3. No explicit restart command
4. Gateway PID confirms restart at 03:01:08 (`ps -o lstart=`)
5. Sub-agent session file never created
6. `clawdbot status` shows no sub-agent session

### Expected Behavior

Gateway should remain stable after cron job completes. Sub-agent should execute.

### Actual Behavior

Gateway restarts ~53 seconds after sub-agent spawn. Sub-agent work is lost.

### Workaround

Using `sessionTarget: "main"` or having cron execute work directly (no sub-agent) avoids this.

### Questions

1. Is spawning sub-agents from isolated cron sessions supported?
2. What caused the gateway restart?
3. Should sub-agent spawns be persisted to survive restarts?

There is a rebrand happening. Stay calm
