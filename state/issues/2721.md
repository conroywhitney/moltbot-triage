## Description

### Description

When a tool (like `read`) returns an image, the webchat UI shows the text metadata but doesn't render the image inline.

**Current behavior:**
- Tool result shows: "Read image file [image/png]" with a "View" link
- The actual image is not displayed

**Expected behavior:**
- Images from tool results should render inline, similar to how Telegram displays them via `MEDIA:` paths

### Technical Details

The webchat UI has image rendering support in `grouped-render.ts` via `extractImages()`, which handles:
- `type: "image"` with base64 source or URL
- `type: "image_url"` (OpenAI format)

However, tool results return images as `output_image` attachments in the content array, which aren't being converted to the renderable format.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open webchat
2. Ask the agent to read an image file: "show me /path/to/image.png"
3. Agent uses `read` tool on the image
4. Webchat shows "Read image file [image/png]" but no actual image

### Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.26 (72fea5e30)
- Browser: Chrome (webchat Control UI)
- Comparison: Same images display correctly in Telegram channel

### Suggested Fix

In the tool result rendering path, detect `output_image` content blocks and convert them to `ImageBlock` format for rendering.
