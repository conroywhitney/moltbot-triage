## Description

## Description

The Antigravity provider (google-antigravity) fails with:
```
This version of Antigravity is no longer supported. Please update to receive the latest features!
```

## Root Cause

The `@mariozechner/pi-ai` package uses outdated User-Agent strings that Google API now rejects:

1. **`dist/utils/oauth/google-antigravity.js`** line ~102:
   ```js
   "User-Agent": "google-api-nodejs-client/9.15.1"
   ```
   Should be: `"antigravity/1.15.8"`

2. **`dist/providers/google-gemini-cli.js`** line ~25:
   ```js
   "User-Agent": "antigravity/1.11.5 darwin/arm64"
   ```
   Should be: `"antigravity/1.15.8 linux/amd64"` (or platform-appropriate)

## Workaround

Manually patching `node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-ai/dist/...` works but is lost on update.

**Workaround**: Until it's fixed upstream, you can manually patch the file:

```bash
# Find and replace the outdated version
sed -i 's/antigravity\/1.15.8/antigravity\/1.15.9/g' $(npm root)/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-ai/dist/providers/google-gemini-cli.js

# Restart your service after patching
```

I've reported this upstream at https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1129

Reinstall will be OK!
