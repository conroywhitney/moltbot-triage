## Description

Summary

Many bundled Clawdbot skills are currently macOS-first and rely on Homebrew or macOS-only binaries (OS: darwin). When running Clawdbot in Linux environments (Docker containers, servers, CI/CD, cloud VMs), a large portion of skills remain permanently in a “missing requirements” state, even though the core Clawdbot platform works well in these environments.

This creates friction for users who want to adopt Clawdbot in server-side, containerized, or production workloads, where macOS and Homebrew are not viable options.

Proposed solution

Improve cross-platform skill support and operability by:
Providing Linux-friendly installation paths for skills where possible
Prefer apt, apk, dnf, npm, pip, or go install over Homebrew
Clearly document supported package managers per skill
Explicitly classify skills by OS and environment
Add metadata such as:
supported_os: [linux, darwin, windows]
environment: workstation | server | container
Hide or auto-disable incompatible skills based on the detected OS
Introduce a non-interactive dependency installer

Example:

clawdbot skills bootstrap --os linux


This would install all Linux-compatible dependencies and skip unsupported skills automatically

- Improve skills check output
Clearly differentiate between:
“Missing dependency (installable)”
“Unsupported OS (will never be ready)”
Reduce confusion for users running in Docker or CI
Provide official Docker images / install guides
Publish a reference Dockerfile for Linux-based Clawdbot usage
Include a recommended baseline skill set for server environments

Alternatives considered
Installing Homebrew inside Linux containers
→ Rejected due to increased image size, security concerns, and poor reproducibility.

Manually building and installing each skill’s dependencies from source
→ Not scalable, error-prone, and difficult to automate across environments.

Ignoring skills entirely in Linux
→ Limits adoption of Clawdbot for backend, infra, and multi-tenant use cases.

Additional context

Observed while running Clawdbot inside Linux Docker containers built on macOS hosts

Many skills report:

OS: ✗ darwin
Install failed: brew not installed

Examples include 1password, bear-notes, apple-notes, wacli, and others
This feature would significantly improve Clawdbot’s usability for:

- Cloud deployments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-tenant AI platforms
- Server-side automation
