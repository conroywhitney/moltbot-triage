## Description

## Summary
Currently the docker install does not install Homebrew making it impossible to install skills without installing Homebrew later

## Proposed solution
Include a homebrew install in the Dockerfile


```
FROM node:22-bookworm

# Bun
RUN curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
ENV PATH="/root/.bun/bin:${PATH}"

# Brew prerequisites (root)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      build-essential ca-certificates curl file git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Prepare Homebrew prefix with correct ownership (root)
RUN mkdir -p /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew \
 && chown -R node:node /home/linuxbrew

# Install Homebrew as non-root (node)
USER node
RUN NONINTERACTIVE=1 /bin/bash -lc \
  "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Persist brew on PATH for later layers
ENV PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/sbin:${PATH}"

# Back to root if you need apt / permissions later
USER root


RUN corepack enable

WORKDIR /app

ARG CLAWDBOT_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES=""
RUN if [ -n "$CLAWDBOT_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES" ]; then \
      apt-get update && \
      DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends $CLAWDBOT_DOCKER_APT_PACKAGES && \
      apt-get clean && \
      rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/cache/apt/archives/*; \
    fi

COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml pnpm-workspace.yaml .npmrc ./
COPY ui/package.json ./ui/package.json
COPY patches ./patches
COPY scripts ./scripts

RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

COPY . .
RUN CLAWDBOT_A2UI_SKIP_MISSING=1 pnpm build
# Force pnpm for UI build (Bun may fail on ARM/Synology architectures)
ENV CLAWDBOT_PREFER_PNPM=1
RUN pnpm ui:install
RUN pnpm ui:build

ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Security hardening: Run as non-root user
# The node:22-bookworm image includes a 'node' user (uid 1000)
# This reduces the attack surface by preventing container escape via root privileges
USER node

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```
