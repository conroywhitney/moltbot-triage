## Description

## Summary

Changes to `meta.lastTouchedAt` in the config don't match any reload rule, causing them to fall through to the restart logic. This triggers unnecessary gateway restarts when only the timestamp metadata changes.

**Version:** v2026.1.24-3

## Evidence

```
[reload] config change requires gateway restart (meta.lastTouchedAt)
```

The `meta.lastTouchedAt` field is just a timestamp and should not require a full restart.

## Proposed Fix

Add a rule to `BASE_RELOAD_RULES` to ignore meta changes:

```javascript
{ prefix: "meta", kind: "none" },
```

This ensures metadata-only changes are treated as no-ops rather than triggering restarts.
