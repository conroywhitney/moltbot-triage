## Description

## Environment
- Clawdbot Version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Windows 11 (10.0.26200)
- Node: v24.11.1

## Bug Description
On Windows, a terminal window (Windows Terminal or conhost) flashes on screen every ~15 seconds, even when the gateway is idle.

## Root Cause
The `@homebridge/ciao` library (used for Bonjour/mDNS discovery) runs `arp -a | findstr /C:"---"` periodically via `NetworkManager.js` to maintain network interface information.

On Windows:
1. This spawns `cmd.exe`
2. cmd.exe triggers Windows Terminal (if set as default) or conhost
3. The window briefly flashes visible before closing

## Workaround
Set `CLAWDBOT_DISABLE_BONJOUR=1` environment variable before starting the gateway.

## Suggested Fix
Consider adding `windowsHide: true` to spawn options in the ciao library calls, or provide a config option to disable Bonjour polling without fully disabling discovery.

Also found some spawn calls in Clawdbot itself missing `windowsHide: true`:
- `dist/process/exec.js:57` - `runCommandWithTimeout`
- `dist/agents/shell-utils.js:78` - taskkill spawn
