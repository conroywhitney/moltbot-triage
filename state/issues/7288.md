## Description

## Summary

An unknown tool call failure result in a "terminated" status, some how poisons the whole jsonl
 file and made session crash.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Let there be a tool call failure ( I don't know exactly how to reproduce this, maybe unstable connection or weird behavior of LLM)
2. You'll see a "terminated" response message in IM apps, like

3. In the jsonl file where session.json "sessionFile" points at, the last lines are like this

Note the "errorMessage":"terminated" part

4. I deleted one line at a time from bottom up.  When I delete the "terminated" line, save, fresh the control dashboard page. Everything is good and my peace come back.

## Related

I found out some info out there says " [clawdbot] missing tool result in session history; inserted synthetic error result for transcript repair." is some how a way that clawdbot bypass the error. But in this case, it kinds of no use.

## Fix

I currently have no idea what happened.

When I'm out of home and this happens, I have no right way to fix remotely. It bad.

I currently have to make a loop job to check the jsonl file where session.json point to, and if there is a line include "terminated" then this job starts its cleaning job.

It's silly, but work.

it seems that there is already an answer about this failure.

but no fix, issue still open

### @cg0xC0DE (2026-02-02)

Update:

After some research I finallly figure out what happened.

When I use CrawdBot Config Wizard and when choosing Minimax as Model (it's cheap~), the wizard set Minimax baseUrl like:

`"baseUrl": "https://api.minimax.io/anthropic"`

It use MiniMax models but with Anthropic API Protocol. Using Anthropic models should duplicate the same bug.

Anthropic protocol is strict, when a historical message contains something like bad tool call result, then Anthropic protocol will reject all from there, thie cause CrawdBot session keep on fail.

Although crawdbot insert synthetic error result to try to fix that bad request, but it's too late. The best practice is ignore the failure and go on.



Another Interesting thing:

If do nothing at all, after 1-2 HEARTBEAT, this bug will be bypassed, and all goes well again. Because the "terminated" message is "pushed out" of the context window and will no longer be included in the historical message giving to Anthropic API Protocol.

But, still, the bug exist and will happen again, it's waste of time to waiting for HEARTBEAT.

Better skip the "insert" step.
