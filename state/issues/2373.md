## Description

## Summary
Relates to #1115 
The openrouter/auto model is configured by default when selecting OpenRouter key. It doesn't work due to the error in the above bug report. This is however not due to the model not being "available" but rather because (if I understood correctly) clawdbot prefixes all openrouter models with `openrouter/` however the openrouter model itself is called `openrouter/auto` so with the clawdbot prefix it should actually be configured as `openrouter/openrouter/auto`.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Setup clawdbot with OpenRouter token
2. Choose the default openrouter/auto model
3. Try to hatch the bot

## Expected behavior
It should use the `openrouter/auto` model correctly.

## Actual behavior
It tries to call the openrouter model `auto`.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): installer script

Can confirm, it doesn't work, only explicitly selected models from Open-router work, not auto one.

### @TrentPierce (2026-01-26)

I just created a PR that should fix this. https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/2395

I just installed, still facing this issue.

@sebslight could you please reopen this? The duplicate (not sure if related) was closed due to inactivity. This issue has activity and (I think) enough infos. Thank you!

### @jaroslawjanas (2026-01-31)

It's as simple as changing the default to `openrouter/openrouter/auto`.
I put it in manually and it worked fine.

confirm the manual replace of `openrouter/openrouter/auto` in `openclaw.json` works
