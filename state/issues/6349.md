## Description

## Problem

Auth profile (e.g., `anthropic:secondary` vs `anthropic:default`) is bound at session start and persists through:
- `/clear` commands (only clears history, not auth binding)
- Config reloads (SIGUSR1)
- Auth profile order changes

Only full gateway restart breaks the binding.

## Expected Behavior

Respect `auth.order` dynamically:
1. Check preferred profile availability on each API call
2. Switch to preferred profile when it becomes available (after cooldown clears or OAuth refreshes)

## Current Workaround

`clawdbot gateway stop && clawdbot gateway start`

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Multiple Anthropic OAuth profiles
- `auth.order.anthropic: ["secondary", "default"]`
