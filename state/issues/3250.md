## Description

## Problem
Sessions accumulate in memory throughout the day without cleanup. Example from a 24h period:
- 100+ sessions created
- Many idle hook sessions at 0 tokens: `hook:github:reviewer:*`, `hook:trello:doublon-check:*`
- No automatic cleanup until gateway restart

## Proposal
Add a configurable TTL for idle sessions, e.g.:
- `sessionTTL: 3600` (seconds of inactivity before cleanup)
- Or `sessionTTL: { idle: 3600, maxAge: 86400 }` for more control

## Workaround
Currently using a daily gateway restart via launchd (4am) to flush sessions.

## Impact
Without TTL, memory usage grows unbounded on busy gateways with many webhook-triggered sessions.
