## Description

## Summary
Run [brabble](https://github.com/steipete/brabble) as a Clawdis node for Star Trek-style "Hello Computer" voice activation anywhere.

## Vision
- Deploy brabble on Raspberry Pi 4 (or any device)
- Connects to Clawdis gateway via Tailscale (like iOS/Android nodes)
- Wake word detection triggers → sends audio/text to gateway
- Gateway routes to agent → response back via TTS

## Use Cases
- "Hey Clawd, turn down lights in bedroom to 10%" → Home Assistant integration
- "Hey Clawd, what's my schedule tomorrow?" → Calendar queries
- "Hey Clawd, play some jazz" → Audio control
- Distributed voice points throughout home/office

## Architecture
```
[Pi + Brabble] --wake word--> [Gateway] --> [Agent]
                                  ^            |
                                  |            v
                              [Response] <-- [TTS]
```

home assistant has a framework for this and open hardware, could be a nice addition too

### @afalk42 (2026-01-26)

This would be a fabulous (or "leiwand", as we Austrians say) feature, especially when used with a USB Speakerphone, such as the Jabra Speak 410 connected to the Raspberry Pi! Any timeline for when this might get implemented?
