## Description

## Description
The "Toggle assistant thinking/working output" button in the dashboard chat interface has insufficient visual contrast in light mode, making it impossible to distinguish between on/off states.

## Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Browser:** Brave (Chromium-based)
- **OS:** macOS 15.3 (Sequoia)
- **Dashboard theme:** Light mode

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open dashboard in light mode
2. Navigate to Chat view
3. Look at the thinking toggle button in the toolbar
4. Click to toggle on/off

## Expected behavior
The toggle should have clear visual distinction between enabled/disabled states (e.g., different colors, opacity, or icon states)

## Actual behavior
The toggle appearance is identical in both states in light mode, making it impossible to determine current state without checking the footer or actual output.

## Workaround
- Use dark mode (toggle is visible there), or
- Check the footer status line which shows `think: low` or similar

## Impact
Accessibility/UX issue - users in light mode cannot determine toggle state visually.
