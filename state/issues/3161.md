## Description

## Problem

When using slower models like Claude Opus, complex tasks can take 30+ seconds before any response is sent. During this time, the user sees nothing and may wonder if the system is working.

## Proposed Solution

Add a configurable **response timeout fallback** that:

1. Starts a timer when a user message is received
2. If the primary model hasn't sent a response within N seconds (configurable, e.g., 30s)
3. Automatically spawns a fast model subagent to send a quick acknowledgment like: *"Working on this - it's taking a bit longer. I'll ping you when done."*
4. The main model continues processing in background
5. When complete, the main response is delivered

## Configuration (suggested)

```yaml
agent:
  responseTimeout:
    enabled: true
    timeoutMs: 30000
    fallbackModel: "google/gemini-2.0-flash"  # or any fast model
    message: "Working on this — it's taking a moment. I'll have an answer shortly."
```

## Why This Matters

- **Opus users** especially feel this pain — the model is brilliant but slower
- Provides immediate feedback that the system is alive and working
- Improves perceived responsiveness without sacrificing model quality
- Particularly valuable for webchat/interactive sessions

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual subagent spawning: Works but requires the agent to predict slowness upfront
- Streaming partial responses: Helps but doesn't solve the "tool call silence" problem
- Cron-based monitoring: Too janky/unreliable

## Additional Context

This came up while using Opus 4.5 as the primary model. Many tasks involve tool calls that take time, and the silence before response feels broken even when everything is working correctly.
