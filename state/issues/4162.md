## Description

The `/cron` page in the Control UI currently shows a count of cron jobs but no details about them.

**Current behavior:** Shows "3 cron jobs" (or similar count) with no further information.

**Expected behavior:** Show a table/list with:
- Job name
- Schedule (human-readable, e.g. "every 15 min" or "hourly")
- Enabled/disabled status
- Last run time and status (ok/error)
- Next scheduled run

Ideally also allow enabling/disabling and viewing run history from this page.

**Version:** 2026.1.24-3
