## Description

## Problem

When running Clawdbot on macOS, tools that require accessibility permissions (like Peekaboo, node scripts with AppleScript/osascript, etc.) fail silently or with permission errors. macOS only grants accessibility permissions to `.app` bundles, not raw executables.

## Current Workaround

Users have to manually create wrapper `.app` bundles (e.g., `NodeRunner.app`) and add them to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility. This is tedious and not discoverable.

## Proposed Solution

Clawdbot should automatically:

1. **Detect when running on macOS** and requiring accessibility permissions
2. **Create a wrapper `.app` bundle** in a standard location (e.g., `~/.clawdbot/apps/ClawdbotRunner.app` or similar)
3. **Prompt the user once** to add this app to Accessibility permissions
4. **Route accessibility-requiring commands** through this wrapper

Alternatively, could provide:
- A `clawdbot setup macos` command that creates the wrapper app
- Documentation on first run with clear instructions
- Detection and helpful error messages when permissions are missing

## Affected Tools

- `peekaboo` (macOS UI automation)
- `osascript` / `osa` calls (AppleScript execution)
- Any node scripts using accessibility APIs
- Potentially others

## Environment

- macOS 25.2.0 (Sequoia)
- Clawdbot running via npm global install

## Related

This impacts any skill that needs to interact with the macOS UI or control other applications.
