## Description

Description
The macOS desktop app (v2026.1.23, build 7750) crashes when attempting to render syntax-highlighted code blocks.

Crash Details
Exception: EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) in _assertionFailure

Stack trace:

0 libswiftCore.dylib  _assertionFailure(_:_:file:line:flags:)
1 Clawdbot            closure #1 in variable initialization expression of static NSBundle.module
2 Clawdbot            one-time initialization function for module
5 Clawdbot            CodeTokenizer.init()
9 Clawdbot            HighlightedTextFragment.Model.tokenize(content:languageHint:)
Root Cause
The binary references a resource bundle that was not included in the app package:

Expected: swiftui-math_SwiftUIMath.bundle
Missing from: /Applications/Clawdbot.app/Contents/Resources/
The Bundle.module accessor in the SwiftUIMath package fails because the resource bundle was not copied during build/packaging.

Environment
App version: 2026.1.23 (7750)
macOS: 26.2 (25C56)
Hardware: Mac Studio M1 Ultra
Workaround
Using Telegram/CLI only (bypasses desktop app).
