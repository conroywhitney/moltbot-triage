## Description

In conversation mode, AI-generated TTS responses are never played back to the caller. The system transcribes user speech correctly and generates AI responses, but the audio never reaches the caller.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Provider: Twilio
- TTS: OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini-tts)
- Streaming: enabled
- Tunnel: Tailscale Funnel

## Root Cause
In `webhook.ts`, `handleInboundResponse()` calls `this.manager.speak()` but never checks the return value. The `speak()` function catches errors and returns `{ success: false, error }` instead of throwing, so TTS failures are silently swallowed.

## Suggested Fix
```typescript
const speakResult = await this.manager.speak(callId, result.text);
if (!speakResult.success) {
  console.error(`[voice-call] Failed to speak: ${speakResult.error}`);
}
