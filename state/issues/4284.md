## Description

## Summary
Add database access tools to allow Clawdbot to query structured data from various databases instead of relying on static or hardcoded information.

## Proposed solution
Introduce a set of database access tools that:
- Support common databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL、SQL Server、Oracle)
- Expose controlled, read-only query capabilities
- Return structured results for agent reasoning and response generation

## Alternatives considered
- Hardcoding database queries in application logic
- Embedding structured data directly into prompts
- Using keyword-based APIs without flexible querying

## Additional context
This enables Clawdbot to handle data-driven use cases such as user lookup, status queries, and operational dashboards.
