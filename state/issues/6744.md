## Description

The Docker-packaged image does not include the `openclaw` command, so it cannot be executed directly inside the container.
For example, after deploying via Docker, it is not possible to execute approval commands within the container, such as `openclaw devices list` and `openclaw devices approve <requestId>`. These commands cannot be executed, and this issue needs to be resolved.

Run `node dist/index.js` instead of openclaw
