## Description

## Description

When a user enters a multi-paragraph message using Shift+Enter in WebChat, the paragraphs are transmitted correctly to the agent (confirmed by agent receiving proper formatting). However, when scrolling back to view that message in the conversation history, the paragraph breaks are lost and the message displays as a single block of text.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open WebChat
2. Type a message with multiple paragraphs using Shift+Enter between them
3. Send the message
4. Continue the conversation so the message scrolls out of view
5. Scroll back up to view the original message
6. Observe: paragraph breaks are gone, text is one block

## Expected Behavior

User messages should preserve paragraph formatting (blank lines / `\n\n`) when displayed in conversation history.

## Actual Behavior

Paragraph breaks are collapsed. Multi-paragraph messages display as a single block of text.

## Notes

- The agent receives the paragraphs correctly (formatting preserved in transmission)
- This appears to be a rendering/display issue only
- Likely the markdown/text renderer isn't preserving `\n\n` as visual paragraph breaks in user messages

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.2.1
- WebChat (macOS)
