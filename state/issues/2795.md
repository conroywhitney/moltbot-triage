## Description

## Summary

Allow Mac app voice input (wake word / push-to-talk) to deliver replies to a specific channel and session, rather than always using "last-used main provider."

## Problem

Voice transcriptions go to the main session (`agent:main:main`) with delivery to the last-used channel. There's no way to configure a fixed destination.

**My use case:** I want voice replies to always go to a specific Discord guild channel (`#private`). But guild channels use isolated sessions (`agent:main:discord:channel:<id>`), so voice and Discord don't share conversation context — even though they're the same agent with identical capabilities.

## Current Behavior

- `VoiceWakeForwarder` sends to main session with `channel: "last"`
- No Mac app or Gateway config to override this
- The Gateway agent API already supports `sessionKey`, `channel`, `to` — voice just doesn't use them

## Proposed Solution

Add options in **Settings → Voice**:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Delivery Channel** | Target provider | `discord` / `whatsapp` / `last` |
| **Delivery Target** | Channel or user ID | `channel:1464756339665272863` |
| **Session Key** | Optional session override | `discord:channel:1464756339665272863` |

Pass these to the existing agent request params. Defaults preserve current behavior (`last` / empty / empty).

## Why This Matters

- **Context continuity**: Voice and chat can share the same session
- **Predictable delivery**: Know exactly where replies land
- **No capability loss**: Same agent, same tools — just unified context

## Implementation Notes

- `VoiceWakeForwarder` already builds the agent request — just needs to read new settings
- Store in `com.clawdbot.mac` UserDefaults (like existing voice settings)
- No Gateway changes required — API already supports the params
- Backward compatible: empty values = current behavior
