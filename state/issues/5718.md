## Description

## Description

When receiving voice notes via Telegram, the audio file is downloaded to `~/.openclaw/media/inbound/` correctly, but the agent only receives a `<media:audio>` placeholder instead of the actual file path.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Send a voice note to the bot via Telegram
2. Observe that the agent receives `<media:audio>` in the message content
3. Check `~/.openclaw/media/inbound/` — the `.ogg` file is there with the correct timestamp

## Expected Behavior

The agent should receive the file path (similar to how images work — logs show "Native image: detected 1 image refs" and the full path is loaded).

## Actual Behavior

- Audio file downloads successfully to inbound folder
- Agent receives only `<media:audio>` placeholder
- No file path is passed, so the agent can't process the audio

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: v2026.1.30
- Channel: Telegram
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Node: v22.21.1

## Workaround

Manually checking the inbound folder for the latest `.ogg` file and processing it works, but it's not ideal.

## Logs

No errors in the logs — the audio just silently doesn't get passed through. Images work fine with the same setup.
