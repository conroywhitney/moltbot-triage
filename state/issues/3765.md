## Description

## Summary

When using Telegram as a channel, exec tool errors are being forwarded to the user's Telegram chat instead of staying internal to the agent's debugging context.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure Clawdbot with Telegram channel enabled
2. Run any exec command that fails (e.g., `grep` with no matches)
3. Observe error message being sent to user's Telegram

## Expected Behavior

Internal tool errors (from `exec` calls by the agent) should:
- Stay in agent's internal context for debugging
- Not be visible to the end user
- Only show up in gateway logs

## Actual Behavior

Error messages like this are being sent to user's Telegram:
```
⚠️ 🛠️ Exec: clawdbot status | grep -A5 "Runtime\|verbose\|elevated\|Think" failed: Command exited with code 1
```

## Environment

- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Channel:** Telegram (bot API, long-polling)
- **Runtime:** direct
- **OS:** macOS 26.2 (arm64)
- **Node:** 22.22.0

## Configuration

All settings verified normal:
- `verboseLevel`: null
- `thinkingLevel`: null  
- `diagnostics`: not set
- `channels.telegram.streamMode`: "partial"

No debug flags or verbose modes enabled.

## Timeline

- User first noticed exec errors being forwarded around 4:48pm PST 2026-01-28
- Started happening after a separate routing issue earlier in the day (4:16pm) where agent replies were going to webchat instead of Telegram
- No configuration changes made by user
- All session settings are at defaults

## Impact

- Confusing for end users who see internal debugging messages
- Clutters Telegram chat with technical error messages
- Unprofessional user experience

## Workaround

Agent can avoid triggering errors by:
- Using `|| true` on commands that might fail
- Checking conditions before running commands
- Being more careful with command syntax

## Notes

This appears to be a regression or unintended behavior in how Telegram channel routes different message types. The timing correlation with the earlier routing issue suggests they may stem from the same underlying cause.
