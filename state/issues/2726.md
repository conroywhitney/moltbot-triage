## Description

## Feature Request

### Problem
The current voice-call plugin only supports PSTN calls via Twilio/Telnyx/Plivo, which incurs per-minute telephony costs (especially expensive for international calls, e.g. ~$0.11/min USA→Italy).

### Proposed Solution
Add support for **WebRTC-based voice calls** that don't go through the phone network. This could work via:

1. **Twilio Client JS SDK** — browser ↔ Twilio WebRTC at ~$0.004/min (no PSTN)
2. **A simple web page** served by the gateway that connects to the voice-call plugin via WebRTC
3. **Integration with existing platforms** (Telegram voice calls, Google Meet, etc.)

### Use Case
Users who want real-time voice conversations with their Clawdbot agent without paying PSTN rates. A simple web link (e.g. `https://my-gateway/voice/call`) that opens a browser-based voice call would be ideal.

### Benefits
- **~97% cheaper** than PSTN calls ($0.004 vs $0.11/min)
- No phone number needed
- Works from any device with a browser
- No international call restrictions or geo-permissions needed
- Could work with the existing ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS already configured

### Additional Context
The voice-call plugin already handles TTS, STT, and conversation flow — the main missing piece is a WebRTC transport layer as an alternative to PSTN.

Submitted via Jarvis (Clawdbot agent).
