## Description

## Bug: No reproducible agent onboarding — each new agent requires manual file creation across 10+ touchpoints

**Problem:**
Onboarding a new agent (gateway instance, Claude Code session, or external model) requires manually creating or editing: identity config, inbox file, status file, SOUL/governance injection, heartbeat config, cron jobs, Telegram bot, Tailscale connection, and workspace setup. There is no template, generator, or checklist enforced by the system.

**Impact:**
Each onboarding takes hours of manual work across scattered files. Easy to miss a step (e.g., BOOT.md was missing for 3 days — root cause of total context loss). Governance rules added after initial onboarding docs are never backported. No validation that onboarding is complete. Cannot scale beyond 2-3 agents without dedicated onboarding tooling.

**Observed:** After 6 days of building governance (10 policies, 15 tools, 50+ memory files), onboarding readiness for 4 planned agents was assessed at 10-60%. All onboarding documentation was stale (pre-dated 8 of 10 current policies).

**Expected:** An onboarding mechanism — template, generator, or wizard — that produces a complete agent seed package with all required files, validated against current governance rules.

**Environment:** OpenClaw 2026.1.30, Windows 10, planning to scale from 2 to 6 agents

**Workaround:** Manual checklist in markdown. Goes stale within days as new rules are added.
