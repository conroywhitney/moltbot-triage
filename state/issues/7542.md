## Description

## Summary

The `extensions/matrix` extension has a transitive dependency on the deprecated `request` package, which has a known SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

- **Severity:** Moderate
- **Package:** `request` (<=2.88.2)
- **Advisory:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6
- **Dependency chain:** `extensions/matrix` → `@vector-im/matrix-bot-sdk` → `request`

## Problem

The `request` package is deprecated and will not receive security patches. The "patched versions" field shows `<0.0.0`, meaning no fix is available.

## Suggested Actions

1. Check if `@vector-im/matrix-bot-sdk` has a newer version that doesn't depend on `request`
2. If not, consider alternative Matrix SDK libraries that use modern HTTP clients (like `undici` or native `fetch`)
3. If no alternatives exist, document the risk and ensure the Matrix bot doesn't process untrusted URLs

## Reproduction

```bash
pnpm audit
```
