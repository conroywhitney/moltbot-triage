## Description

## Summary
Slash commands work inconsistently across different OpenClaw interfaces (TUI, WhatsApp, Webchat).

## Observed Behavior

| Command | TUI | WhatsApp | Webchat (Dashboard) |
|---------|-----|----------|---------------------|
| `/status` | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | ❌ No output |
| `/compact` | ❌ No output | ✅ Works | ❌ No output |

## Expected Behavior
All slash commands should work consistently across all interfaces.

## Root Cause Analysis (from gateway.log)

WhatsApp commands successfully flow through the `web-auto-reply` → `deliver-reply` pipeline:
```
module: "web-auto-reply"
body: "/compact"
→ "auto-reply sent (text)" ✅
```

Webchat appears to use a different route that doesn't process slash commands the same way - commands are recognized (message disappears) but no response is rendered.

## Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.1.29 (a5b4d22)
- OS: Windows 11
- Node: v22.20.0

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open webchat dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:18789/
2. Type `/status` or `/compact`
3. Message disappears but no output is shown

Compare with WhatsApp where both commands return proper responses.

## Additional Context
- Gateway bound to loopback (127.0.0.1:18789)
- WhatsApp: linked and working
- TUI: `/status` works but `/compact` doesn't

I've been tracking this issue because I had the same problem with /status on my web chat UI. What I discovered is that after a clean new install, everything was working fine until I enabled the WhatsApp channel. As soon as I had the binding to my new phone number, it stopped working and all the slash commands started behaving like you described. I think there is something going on when you have WhatsApp enabled and it's messing up with the sessions and permissions somehow. Something changes in the backend and the web chat UI believes that you don't have permissions to send that command and censored it. There are other issues open that relate to this one. I think it's more a bug than an inconsistency across interfaces.
