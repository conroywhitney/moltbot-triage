## Description

## Bug Description
On a headless Ubuntu Linux node, the `exec-approvals.sock` socket file is never created, causing all exec commands to timeout with SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED.

## Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Gateway:** Running in Docker on Unraid (192.168.1.9)
- **Node:** Headless Ubuntu 24.04 on Beelink Mini PC (192.168.1.188)
- **Node installed via:** npm global install, systemd user service

## Symptoms
1. Node shows as "paired · connected" in gateway status
2. All `nodes run` commands timeout after 35 seconds
3. Gateway logs show `exec.approval.request` timing out at 120001ms
4. The socket file `~/.clawdbot/exec-approvals.sock` is never created
5. Node logs only show PATH initialization, no approval daemon startup

## What I've Tried
- Configured allowlist with `*` pattern for all agents
- Set `defaults.security: "full"` in exec-approvals.json
- Set `tools.exec.ask: "off"` in clawdbot.json
- Used `--security full` flag on gateway commands
- Reinstalled node service
- Updated to beta channel and back to stable

## Expected Behavior
The node should create the exec-approvals.sock socket and respond to approval requests, or respect the allowlist/security settings to bypass approval.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Install clawdbot globally on headless Ubuntu: `npm i -g clawdbot`
2. Configure remote gateway in clawdbot.json
3. Install and start node service: `clawdbot node install`
4. Verify node connects: shows "paired · connected"
5. Try to run command: `clawdbot nodes run --node <name> --agent <agent> echo test`
6. Command times out with "gateway timeout after 35000ms"
