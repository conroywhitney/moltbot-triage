## Description

## Environment
- macOS 26.2 (Build 25C56)
- OpenClaw 2026.1.30
- Install: npm global
- Setup: Headless node host on Mac → remote gateway (Linux via Tailscale)

## Description
The macOS companion app crashes whenever there's a pending exec approval request. Navigating to a view where an approval is queued causes immediate crash. No approval dialog is ever shown.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect Mac as node to remote gateway
2. Configure exec-approvals.json with `security: "allowlist"` and `ask: "on-miss"`
3. Trigger a command not in the allowlist from the gateway (e.g., `sw_vers`)
4. Approval request is sent to node
5. Open/navigate the macOS app → crash

## Expected Behavior
Approval dialog should appear, allowing user to approve/deny the command.

## Actual Behavior
App crashes before dialog renders. Command falls through to `askFallback: "deny"`.

## Workaround
Run headless node host without the macOS app. Expand allowlist manually since approval UI is unavailable.

## Notes
Suspect the crash is in approval dialog rendering or the IPC handling between node host and app.
