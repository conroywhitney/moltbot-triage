## Description

## Summary
I want to run moltbot on an IBM Power Server. Unfortunately, the platform is not supported. 


## Proposed solution
It would be great if as many platforms as possible were supported. 

## Additional context

```
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash

  🦞 Moltbot Installer
  I run on caffeine, JSON5, and the audacity of "it worked on my machine."
