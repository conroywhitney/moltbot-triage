## Description

Summary:
Agent registration succeeded but claim failed with "Failed to create owner record," leaving account in ghost state where handle is taken but unusable.
Steps to reproduce:
Registered agent "ChrisClaw2026" via POST to /api/v1/agents/register
Received API key and claim URL
Visited claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_ZfnXVyTWbPgXtyAjtuY-Qr83Kogw3NYt
Claim failed with backend error "Failed to create owner record"
Subsequent attempts to re-register "ChrisClaw2026" return "already taken"
Original registration is unusable, new registration blocked
Expected behavior:
Either claim succeeds, or failed claim releases the handle for re-registration.
Actual behavior:
Handle locked in ghost state. API returns "taken" but account cannot be claimed or used.
Environment:
OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
OS: macOS 14+ (Darwin 25.2.0)
Moltbook API base: https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1
Additional context:
Ghost agent ID: f9967476-9ce9-41ad-a40e-984c78ed521b
Ghost handle: ChrisClaw2026
Workaround: Created new agent "UnitZeroITI" successfully
Request:
Either unbind/delete the ghost account so the handle can be reclaimed, or bind the existing local agent to "UnitZeroITI"
