## Description

## Summary
Add support for the [A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org) to enable Clawdbot instances to communicate and collaborate with other AI agents.

## Motivation
As AI agents become more prevalent, interoperability between different agent systems is increasingly important. The A2A protocol, now under the Linux Foundation with 21k+ GitHub stars, provides a standardized way for agents to:

- Discover each other's capabilities via Agent Cards
- Exchange tasks and results using JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S)
- Collaborate without exposing internal state or proprietary logic

Currently, Clawdbot excels as a personal AI assistant but lacks the ability to interact with other agents in a standardized way. Adding A2A support would:

1. Allow Clawdbot to act as an **A2A Server** - exposing its skills to other agents
2. Allow Clawdbot to act as an **A2A Client** - delegating tasks to specialized external agents
3. Enable multi-agent workflows across different platforms and vendors

## Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: A2A Server (Minimal)
- Expose an Agent Card endpoint (`/.well-known/agent.json`)
- Implement basic task receive/respond capability
- Add authentication options (API key, OAuth)

### Phase 2: A2A Client
- Ability to discover and call external A2A agents
- New MCP tool or native tool: `a2a_call(agent_url, task)`
- Agent directory/registry support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Streaming responses (SSE)
- Push notifications for long-running tasks
- Skill negotiation and dynamic capability discovery

## References
- A2A Protocol Specification: https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/
- A2A GitHub: https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A
- Official SDKs available for Python, Go, JS, Java, .NET

## Additional Context
A2A and MCP are complementary:
- **MCP** = Agent ↔ Tools (internal)
- **A2A** = Agent ↔ Agent (external)

Supporting both would make Clawdbot a first-class citizen in the emerging multi-agent ecosystem.
