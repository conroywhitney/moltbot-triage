## Description

## Description
The "Test Remote" button in the macOS app's Settings → General fails when using a non-standard SSH port in the format `user@host:port` (e.g., `admin@gateway.example.com:2222`).

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open Clawdbot macOS app
2. Go to Settings → General
3. Set "Clawdbot runs" to "Remote over SSH"
4. Enter SSH target with non-standard port: `user@host:2222`
5. Click "Test Remote"

## Expected behavior
The test should connect to the remote host on port 2222.

## Actual behavior
The test fails because the port is not parsed from the target string. The SSH command is executed without the `-p 2222` flag.

## Root cause
`GeneralSettings.sshCheckCommand()` passes the raw target string directly to SSH without parsing out the port. Other parts of the codebase (e.g., `CommandResolver.parseSSHTarget()`, `RemotePortTunnel`) correctly parse `user@host:port` format and use the `-p` flag.

## Environment
- macOS app
- Any version using SSH remote mode with non-standard ports
