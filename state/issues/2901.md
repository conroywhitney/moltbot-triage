## Description

## Summary
When `channels.matrix.encryption: true` is enabled, the docs state the bot will request device verification from other sessions on startup. However, this fails silently.

## Error
```
{"error":"TypeError: client.crypto.requestOwnUserVerification is not a function"}
```

## Result
Bot device remains permanently unverified in Element, showing red shield warning ("Encrypted by a device not verified by its owner").

## Environment
- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24
- Matrix plugin: bundled (v2026.1.24)
- OS: Windows
- Homeserver: Synapse (self-hosted)

## Expected
Verification request sent to other sessions per docs ("On first connection, Moltbot requests device verification from your other sessions")

## Actual
Function `requestOwnUserVerification` doesn't exist in the crypto SDK, verification never fires.
