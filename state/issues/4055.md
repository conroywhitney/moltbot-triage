## Description

## Summary

The TUI displays a persistent token/context usage bar (e.g. `tokens 117k/200k (59%)`) which is very useful to know when the context window is getting full and will be compacted/wiped.

The WebChat (Control UI chat tab) currently has no equivalent. Users have to manually run `/status` to check context usage.

## Proposal

Add a small persistent context usage indicator to the WebChat chat tab — ideally in the top bar or chat controls area. Something like:

```
📚 26k/200k (13%)
```

This could update after each response using the data already available from the gateway (the same data `/status` returns).

## Why

- Helps users anticipate when compaction/context wipe will happen
- The TUI already has this — webchat should have parity
- The data is already available server-side, just needs a UI element

## Current Workaround

Running `/status` manually in chat, which shows context usage but requires an extra step each time.
