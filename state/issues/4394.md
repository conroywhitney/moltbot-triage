## Description

## Summary
Currently, heartbeat supports a single `every` interval with optional `activeHours`. Weekday vs weekend usage patterns are often very different, but there's no way to vary the heartbeat frequency based on day of week.

## Proposed solution
Allow multiple schedules keyed by day of week:
```json
"heartbeat": {
  "schedules": [
    {
      "days": ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"],
      "every": "15m",
      "activeHours": { "start": "17:00", "end": "03:00" }
    },
    {
      "days": ["sat", "sun"],
      "every": "2h",
      "activeHours": { "start": "10:00", "end": "00:00" }
    }
  ],
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
```

## Alternatives considered
- Use cron jobs instead of heartbeat — Works but loses the HEARTBEAT.md integration and requires managing separate jobs
- Just pick one interval — Current workaround, but wastes tokens on weekends or misses check-ins on weekdays

### @mollywires (2026-01-30)

I had this problem and just solved it outside the heartbeat config. My HEARTBEAT.md tells the agent to run a shell script that figures out what's actually due.

Each task is its own markdown file with `check_every` in the frontmatter. Script reads those, checks timestamps from a local state file, prints whichever ones need attention. Agent reads the file, does the thing, stamps it done. Dead simple.

Tasks run at whatever frequency they want without touching the heartbeat interval. You could add a `days` field to the frontmatter too if you wanted weekday/weekend splits.

Not the same thing as variable polling, but honestly more useful.
