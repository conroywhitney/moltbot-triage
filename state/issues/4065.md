## Description

## Feature Request

**Description:**
Add support for sending typing indicators (the "..." bubble) in iMessage conversations when the agent is processing a request that takes time.

**Use case:**
When a user sends a message that requires research, API calls, or multi-step processing, it would improve UX to show the typing indicator so they know the agent is working on it — similar to how a human would appear to be typing.

**Current behavior:**
No visual feedback until the response is sent.

**Desired behavior:**
Option to trigger typing indicator when starting a longer task, e.g.:
- `imsg typing --to +1234567890 --start`
- `imsg typing --chat-id 1 --stop`

Or automatic typing indicator when composing via `imsg send`.

**Technical notes:**
This may require AppleScript or private APIs to trigger the Messages app's compose state. May not be feasible depending on macOS sandboxing constraints.

**Requested by:** User feedback (EP)
