## Description

## Problem
When the AI is thinking for a long time, the "typing..." indicator in Telegram only shows briefly (5-6 seconds) and then disappears before the reply is sent.

## Current Behavior
The code has `sendChatAction(chatId, "typing")` but it's only sent once at the start of the reply. Telegram's typing indicators expire after ~5-6 seconds.

## Expected Behavior
The typing indicator should be refreshed periodically (every 3-5 seconds) while the AI is generating a response, similar to how Signal channel does.

## Suggested Solution
Add a periodic refresh loop in the typing callback infrastructure.

## Context
- Channel: Telegram (grammY)
- Relevant files: `dist/telegram/bot-message-context.js`, `dist/telegram/bot-message-dispatch.js`, `dist/channels/typing.js`

Hi! I’d like to work on this issue and implement periodic refresh for Telegram typing indicators. Could you assign it to me?
