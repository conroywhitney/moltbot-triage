## Description

## Feature Request

Add support for SearXNG as a fallback search provider when the primary (Brave) fails or runs out of credits.

## Use Case

- Brave Search has rate limits / credit limits on the free tier
- SearXNG is self-hosted and unlimited
- Having SearXNG as automatic fallback would provide resilient search without API costs

## Proposed Config

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "search": {
        "provider": "brave",
        "fallbacks": [
          {
            "provider": "searxng",
            "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8888"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## SearXNG Details

- Open source meta-search engine
- JSON API: `/search?q=query&format=json`
- Aggregates DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, etc.
- Easy Docker deployment: `searxng/searxng:latest`

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- SearXNG running on same host (Docker)

Already have SearXNG running and tested - happy to help test if this gets implemented! 🦞

We hope you will support this feature.

### @He-Xun (2026-01-27)

It would be better to support searxng as the default search engine

### @StrangerGithuber (2026-01-28)

Indeed it would be much better to have searxng as the default search engine because it is free compared with brave.
