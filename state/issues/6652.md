## Description

## Bug Description
When a reply contains markdown tables and is moderately long (~2000+ chars), the message sent to Telegram can be empty, resulting in:

```
[telegram] sendMessage failed: Call to 'sendMessage' failed! (400: Bad Request: message text is empty)
[telegram] final reply failed: GrammyError: Call to 'sendMessage' failed! (400: Bad Request: message text is empty)
```

## Reproduction
1. Send a reply with markdown tables (using | for columns)
2. Reply should be ~2000+ characters
3. Message arrives empty to Telegram

## Expected Behavior
Message should either:
- Render correctly (tables converted to text)
- Fall back to plain text if markdown fails
- Never send empty message

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Channel: Telegram
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu on VPS)

## Logs
```
2026-02-01T22:37:06.083Z [telegram] sendMessage failed: Call to 'sendMessage' failed! (400: Bad Request: message text is empty)
```

## Workaround
Avoid markdown tables in Telegram replies; use bullet lists instead.
