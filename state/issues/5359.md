### @feelsunbreeze (2026-01-31)

What version is latest by noe?

### @just1270 (2026-01-31)

Yes, this looks like the same issue.

In my case, the problem was not the OpenClaw config.
Antigravity UI shows “outdated” because the Google Gemini provider reports an old Antigravity version.

Fix:
I restored openclaw.json to default and only updated the version string inside:

node_modules/openclaw/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-ai/dist/providers/google-gemini-cli.js


from:

antigravity/1.11.5


to:

antigravity/1.15.8


After that, Antigravity UI stopped showing the outdated warning and everything worked normally.

Where did you find that string?  I don't have that in my config file.  Same thing is bugging me for 2 days now.

### @rodrigogs (2026-01-31)

For me localhost:51121 is not available to receive the callback

### @MartinP7r (2026-02-01)

If you're on macOS try installing the macOS app. Running it's startup wizard resolved the issues for me.
