## Description

## Description

When sending `/new` command in a **private DM to a different Telegram bot**, Clawdbot incorrectly receives and processes the command, showing a "new session started" message.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have Clawdbot running with Telegram channel configured
2. Open a separate private DM with a different Telegram bot
3. Send `/new` to that other bot
4. Observe Clawdbot responding with a new session message

## Expected Behavior

Commands sent in private DMs to other bots should not be received or processed by Clawdbot. Telegram DMs are isolated per-bot.

## Actual Behavior

Clawdbot receives and processes the `/new` command even though it was sent to a completely different bot in a separate DM conversation.

## Environment

- Channel: Telegram
- Clawdbot version: (current)
- Context: Private DMs (not group chats)

## Notes

This suggests either:
- A Telegram webhook/polling configuration issue where messages are being routed incorrectly
- Some shared state or chat ID collision
- A bug in how Clawdbot filters incoming Telegram updates
