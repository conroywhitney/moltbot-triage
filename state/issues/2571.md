## Description

## Summary

Clawdbot is powerful, but it’s hard to predict how much a task will cost before it runs, especially for complex workflows with multiple steps, tool calls, and long outputs.
This often leads to two bad experiences: either I hesitate to run tasks at all, or I only realize the cost is too high after it’s already been spent.

A pre-run cost estimate and budget control would significantly improve trust, usability, and cost safety.

## Proposed solution

Introduce a Cost Preview & Budget Guardrail system that works before and during execution.

Pre-run cost estimate

Before execution (or via a confirmation modal), show:
	•	Estimated token usage (input / output)
	•	Estimated tool calls (broken down by tool type: web, code, retrieval, etc.)
	•	Estimated total cost as a range (min / likely / max)
	•	Optional: estimated runtime

Include a short, expandable explanation of the estimate:
	•	Planned number of steps
	•	Expected output length per step (short / medium / long or token ranges)
	•	Expected number of web pages, retrieval calls, or code executions

## Alternatives considered

1.	Using max_tokens only
	•	Controls output length but not tool usage or total cost.
	2.	Manually stopping execution
	•	Requires constant monitoring and often stops too late.
	3.	Flat or fixed cost multipliers
	•	Too coarse for tool-heavy or multi-step agent workflows.
