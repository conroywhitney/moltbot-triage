## Description

## Problem

During generation, the only way to stop is clicking the Stop button. There's no keyboard shortcut.

## Expected

Press Escape to stop generation (common UX pattern in chat interfaces).

## Proposed solution

Add keydown listener for Escape key that triggers stop (same as Stop button). Show 'Esc' hint on the Stop button.

## Environment

- Moltbot Web UI (Control Panel)
