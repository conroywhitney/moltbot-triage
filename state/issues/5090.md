## Description

Environment                                                                                                                                                                 
 - OpenClaw.app: 2026.1.29 (build 8345)                                                                                                                                      
 - Gateway: remote (Linux)                                                                                                                                                   
 - macOS node: macOS 26.3.0                                                                                                                                                  
 - remindctl: 0.1.1 installed via brew install steipete/tap/remindctl                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
 What I expected                                                                                                                                                             
 Running remindctl via OpenClaw’s macOS node (system.run) should be able to request Reminders permission and then list/add reminders.                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
 What happens                                                                                                                                                                
 - When executed via OpenClaw node (system.run), remindctl authorize returns:                                                                                                
     - Reminders access: Denied (exit 1)                                                                                                                                     
     - remindctl status shows Not determined                                                                                                                                 
     - No permission prompt appears and OpenClaw (or helper) never shows up in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Reminders.                                             
 - When executed in Terminal directly, Reminders works:                                                                                                                      
     - remindctl authorize → Reminders access: Full access                                                                                                                   
     - remindctl today lists reminders normally.

 OpenClaw.app’s Info.plist appears to be missing the required usage string:                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                             
 ```bash                                                                                                                                                                     
   defaults read /Applications/OpenClaw.app/Contents/Info.plist NSRemindersUsageDescription                                                                                  
   # => NSRemindersUsageDescription MISSING                                                                                                                                  
 ```                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Why this matters                                                                                                                                                            
 Without NSRemindersUsageDescription, macOS won’t show the Reminders permission prompt for OpenClaw.app, so any Reminders access via OpenClaw-run processes is silently      
 denied. This makes the bundled apple-reminders skill unusable unless users route execution through Terminal as a workaround.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Suggested fix                                                                                                                                                               
 Add NSRemindersUsageDescription to the macOS app Info.plist (and ensure the requesting process is the one the user can grant permission to). Potentially document that the  
 app needs this key for the apple-reminders skill.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Workaround                                                                                                                                                                  
 Run remindctl through Terminal (which already has Reminders permission), e.g. via AppleScript.
