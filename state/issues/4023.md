## Description

## Summary
Proposing to add DingTalk as a new messaging channel, implemented as an extension plugin.

## Background
DingTalk is one of the most popular enterprise communication platforms in China with over 500 million users. Adding DingTalk support would enable Moltbot users to interact with their bots through DingTalk.

## Proposed Implementation

### Architecture
- **Extension plugin** at `extensions/dingtalk/`
- **Stream mode** connection via WebSocket (no public URL/webhook needed)
- **Multi-account support** with per-account configuration

### Key Features
- Stream mode using official `dingtalk-stream` SDK
- Group allowlist/policy checking with @mention requirements
- DM pairing flow for user authorization
- Core type definitions integrated into Moltbot config system

### Files to be added/modified
- New extension: `extensions/dingtalk/` (~1800 lines)
- Core types: `src/config/types.dingtalk.ts` (~90 lines)
- Schema updates: `src/config/zod-schema.providers-core.ts` (~60 lines)
- Documentation: `docs/channels/dingtalk.md`
- Label config: `.github/labeler.yml`

## Questions for Maintainers
1. Is the extension plugin approach acceptable for DingTalk?
2. Should the core type definitions be split into a separate PR?
3. Any preferences on the configuration schema design?
4. Would you prefer this as a single PR or split into smaller PRs?
