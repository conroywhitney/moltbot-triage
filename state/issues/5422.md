## Description

## Description
Attaching images in webchat triggers an "event gap detected" error and fails. The file picker opens but after selecting a file, the error appears and no image is attached.

## Error
```
event gap detected (expected seq X, got X+1); refresh recommended
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open webchat at localhost
2. Click attach image button
3. Select an image file
4. Error appears, image not attached

## Attempted Fixes
- Refreshing the page
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Restarting the gateway (`openclaw gateway restart`)
- Different browsers

None resolved the issue.

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- macOS (arm64)
- Node: v24.13.0 / v25.4.0

## Notes
- Paste (Cmd+V) and drag-drop do not appear to be supported in webchat
- No errors in browser console

## Comments

### @HoltChas (2026-02-01)

Yes, I also encountered this issue, but there's still a chance it can be sent successfully

### @jfperren-r2 (2026-02-02)

I also encountered this issue. For now, I just put the files in a disk location that I give Claw, but that's obviously a suboptimal workflow.
