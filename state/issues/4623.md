I was about to submit a PR but someone already made the PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.ai/pull/28

## Fix Available in openclaw.ai Repository

This issue has already been addressed in PR https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.ai/pull/28 by @bchelli.

**Why the confusion?**
This issue was filed in `openclaw/openclaw` (main codebase), but the bug is actually in the **website** code at `openclaw/openclaw.ai`.

**What's fixed in PR #28:**
- ✅ All 31 instances of `clawhub.com` → `clawhub.ai`
- ✅ Homepage CTA link (`src/pages/index.astro`)
- ✅ 29 integration documentation links (`src/pages/integrations.astro`)
- ✅ Showcase CTA button (`src/pages/showcase.astro`)

**Current status:**
- PR #28 is **OPEN** and ready to merge
- Passed Vercel Agent Review ✅
- Waiting for Vercel deployment authorization from team member

**Recommendation:**
Once PR #28 is merged, this issue can be closed. No further code changes needed.
