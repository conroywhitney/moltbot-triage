## Description

## Summary

When `workspaceAccess: "ro"` is set in sandbox config, the filesystem mount works correctly (`/agent` has fresh files from the host workspace), but **Project Context injection** still reads from the sandbox copy (`/workspace`), which is stale.

## Expected vs Actual

- ✅ Filesystem: `/agent` correctly shows current workspace (ro mount works)
- ❌ Project Context: Still injected from `/workspace` (stale copy)

## Evidence

| Location | AGENTS.md |
|----------|-----------|
| `/workspace` (sandbox copy) | 159 lines, dated Jan 24 — **stale** |
| `/agent` (ro mount) | 333 lines, dated Jan 27 — **current** |
| System prompt | Contains the stale 159-line version |

## Impact

Workspace edits invisible to sandboxed agents. No workaround exists for system prompt injection — agents see outdated AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, etc. even though the ro mount has current files.

## Reproduction

1. Configure agent with `sandbox.mode: "non-main"` and `workspaceAccess: "ro"`
2. Edit workspace files (e.g., add content to AGENTS.md)
3. Start sandboxed session
4. Agent's Project Context (system prompt) contains old version from sandbox copy
5. `exec cat /agent/AGENTS.md` shows current version — but injected context is stale

## Suggested Fix

Project Context injection should check `sandbox.workspaceAccess`:
- If `"ro"`: Load context files from the ro mount point (`/agent`)
- If `"none"`: Load from sandbox copy (`/workspace`)
