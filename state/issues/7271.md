## Description

## Description

Single inbound WhatsApp messages trigger multiple "Auto-replied" events within milliseconds, resulting in duplicate responses to users.

## Evidence from gateway.log

```
2026-02-02T16:10:38.348Z [whatsapp] Auto-replied to +1321XXXXXXX
2026-02-02T16:10:38.355Z [whatsapp] Auto-replied to +1321XXXXXXX
2026-02-02T16:10:38.364Z [whatsapp] Auto-replied to +1321XXXXXXX
```

Three auto-replies within **16 milliseconds** for a single inbound message.

Another instance:
```
2026-02-02T15:28:38.719Z [whatsapp] Auto-replied to +1321XXXXXXX
2026-02-02T15:28:38.733Z [whatsapp] Auto-replied to +1321XXXXXXX
2026-02-02T15:28:38.744Z [whatsapp] Auto-replied to +1321XXXXXXX
```

## Expected Behavior

One inbound message → one auto-reply event

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1 (also observed on 2026.1.29)
- Channel: WhatsApp
- Config: `debounceMs: 0` (default)

## Possible Causes

- Race condition in message event handler
- Event listener registered multiple times
- Missing deduplication on message processing

## Workaround

Setting `channels.whatsapp.debounceMs` to 500+ may help coalesce duplicate events, but this treats the symptom rather than root cause.
