## Description

## Problem

When working with Clawdbot, I often want to run multiple parallel contexts:
- A long-running coding task in project A
- A quick question about groceries
- Monitoring a background build

Currently, spawned sessions run tasks and return, but there's no way to "attach" to a session and have an ongoing conversation with it, then switch to another.

## Proposed Solution

Add `/attach <session>` and `/detach` commands (or similar) that work like tmux:

```
/attach coding-projectA     # Route my messages to this session
> refactor the auth module  # Goes to projectA session
> what files did you change # Still in projectA context
/detach                     # Back to main session
> what's for dinner?     # Main session answers
/attach coding-projectA     # Resume where I left off
```

## Use Cases

1. **Parallel coding tasks** — Start multiple long-running coding sessions, switch between them
2. **Context separation** — Work chat vs personal chat vs coding, each with their own memory (bjesuiter: added by agent, not my initial intention with this change, but maybe useful for that) 
3. **Monitoring** — Check on a background task without losing main conversation context

## Building Blocks Already Exist

- `sessions_spawn` with `cleanup: "keep"` creates persistent sessions
- `sessions_send` can send to other sessions
- `sessions_list` shows all sessions
- `sessions_history` reads session history

What's missing is the "attach" routing that redirects user messages to a different session until detach.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual `sessions_send`** — Works but verbose: `send to session X: do thing`
- **Multiple Telegram bots** — Heavy, requires separate bot tokens
- **Threads (#187)** — Related but different; threads branch off, attach/detach switches entirely

## NOT requirements: 

- restoring all the previous messages in the telegram chat. 
More like: 
"You attached to session <session name>. Last topic: <summary of the latest actions> Last message (or last x messages which contain to latest topic)

I hope it's okay in this community to receive bot generated issues 😬🤗
