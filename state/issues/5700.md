## Description

## Description

When multiple Telegram bot accounts are configured in the same group with bindings to different agents, all incoming messages route to the default agent instead of the agent specified in the binding.

## Expected Behavior

Messages received by Bot A (bound to Agent A) should create/route to `agent:agentA:telegram:group:...` sessions.
Messages received by Bot B (bound to Agent B) should create/route to `agent:agentB:telegram:group:...` sessions.

## Actual Behavior

All messages from the group, regardless of which bot account received them, route to `agent:main:telegram:group:...` (the default agent).

**Key observation:** The bots DO show typing indicators when they receive messages, indicating they are processing. However, no response ever appears, and no agent-specific sessions are created.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Configure multiple Telegram bot accounts in `channels.telegram.accounts`
2. Add the same group ID to multiple bot accounts' `groups` config
3. Create bindings mapping each accountId to a different agentId for the same group
4. Verify bindings with `clawdbot agents list --bindings` (shows correct routing rules)
5. Send a message in the group
6. Observe: typing indicator appears for both bots, but only default agent responds

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Telegram (forum group with topics)

## Additional Context

- DM routing works correctly
- Sending works (bots can send to group)
- Auth is valid for each agent
- Session stores exist per agent
