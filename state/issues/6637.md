## Description

## Description
The brand logo in the Control UI header (top-left corner) shows a broken image placeholder.

## Root Cause
The logo is loaded from an external CDN that returns `403 sig_invalid`.

**Affected URL:**
```
https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE&q=85&s=da2032e9eac3b5d9bfe7eb96ca6a8a26
```

**Location in code:** `dist/control-ui/assets/index-*.js` (line ~3807)

## Version
`2026.1.30`

## Workaround
Replace the CDN URL with `/favicon.svg` in the bundled JS file.

## Suggested Fix
Use a local asset or embed the SVG inline to avoid external CDN dependency.
