## Description

## Problem

Outbound messages from OpenClaw's WhatsApp Web integration to a linked device are consistently stuck in a 'waiting for this message' state on the recipient device, even though:

- **Inbound messages work perfectly** — Messages from the linked device to OpenClaw are received without issue
- **Outbound delivery succeeds** — Gateway logs show 'Sent chunk 1/1' confirmations
- **The session reconnects fine** — Fresh QR code scans establish new sessions successfully

This happens on both the linked phone device AND WhatsApp Web simultaneously, suggesting a server-side encryption issue rather than a client-side problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Link OpenClaw's WhatsApp Web session via QR code to a phone device
2. Send a message from OpenClaw to the linked device
3. On the linked device, messages appear as 'waiting for this message' indefinitely

## Expected Behavior

Messages should decrypt and display normally on the linked device, just like inbound messages do.

## Logs

Gateway logs show successful outbound transmission:
```
Sent chunk 1/1 (1001ms)
Auto-replied successfully
```

But client shows persistent decryption failure.

## Hypothesis

OpenClaw's WhatsApp Web E2E encryption context may not properly align with WhatsApp's server expectations for outbound linked device messages. The inbound path works, suggesting the issue is specific to how outbound encryption keys are managed or rotated.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- Node version: 22.22.0
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-90-generic (x64)
- Channel: WhatsApp Web (linked device mode)

## Comments

### @tenumars (2026-01-30)

The inbound messages from the agent say "Waiting for this message. This may take a while" and link to this support document.
