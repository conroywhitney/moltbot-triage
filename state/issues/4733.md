## Description

• Working version: 2026.1.24
• Broken version: 2026.1.29
• Platform: Telegram with Threaded Mode enabled
• Issue: Bot replies are sent to main chat instead of inside the thread where the user sent the message
• Expected behavior: Replies should stay inside the same thread (using message_thread_id)
Steps to reproduce:

1. Enable Threaded Mode in BotFather mini app
2. Set streamMode: "partial" in config
3. Send a message inside a thread
4. Bot reply appears outside the thread instead of inside it

Config:

{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "botToken": --,
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "streamMode": "partial"    }
  }
}
