## Description

### Problem

When a tool call fails (e.g., Brave Search rate limit 429), the full error is injected into the outbound message delivered to the channel (Slack, Telegram, etc.). This exposes internal implementation details to end users.

**Example:** A Slack DM user asked for a web search. Two Brave Search calls were made — the second hit the free plan rate limit. The delivered Slack message included:

```
⚠️ 🔍 Web Search: query gold price today silver price today January 2025 , count 5  failed: Brave Search API error (429): {"type":"ErrorResponse","error":{"id":"58c5c726...","status":429,"detail":"Request rate limit exceeded for plan","meta":{"plan":"Free","rate_limit":1,...}}}
```

This was appended to an otherwise clean, useful response.

### Source

The error injection appears to originate from `pi-embedded-runner/run/payloads.js` (~line 138 in dist):
```js
text: `⚠️ ${toolSummary} failed${errorSuffix}`,
```

### Proposed Solution

One or more of:
1. **Config option** like `agents.defaults.suppressToolErrors: true` to hide failed tool results from outbound messages
2. **Sanitize error output** — strip raw JSON/stack traces, show only a human-readable summary (e.g., "Web search temporarily unavailable")
3. **Channel-level control** — `channels.slack.showToolErrors: false` so agents can suppress errors on external-facing channels while keeping them visible on the owner channel

### Environment
- Clawdbot `2026.1.24-3`
- Channel: Slack (Socket Mode)
- Tool: `web_search` (Brave API, free plan)
