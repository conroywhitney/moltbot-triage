## Description

# Summary

When installing a plugin from npm, the installation folder name is derived from the npm package name (package.json name field) rather than the plugin manifest ID (clawdbot.plugin.json id field). This forces plugin authors to use verbose, namespace-prefixed IDs instead of clean short names.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a plugin with:
   - package.json: "name": "clawdbot-weather"
   - clawdbot.plugin.json: "id": "weather"
2. Publish to npm as clawdbot-weather
3. Run clawdbot plugins install clawdbot-weather

## Expected behavior

Plugin installs to ~/.clawdbot/extensions/weather/ using the manifest ID, allowing:
- Short plugin ID: weather
- Short clean install path ~/.clawdbot/extensions/weather 

## Actual behavior

Plugin installs to ~/.clawdbot/extensions/clawdbot-weather/ using npm package name, forcing:
- Verbose plugin ID: clawdbot-weather
- Verbose paths: ~/.clawdbot/extensions/clawdbot-weather/

Additionally, if manifest ID (weather) differs from folder name (clawdbot-weather), warnings occur on every gateway start.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux (Debian 12)
- Install method: npm

## Logs or screenshots

dist/plugins/install.js lines 63-64:

```javascript
const pkgName = typeof manifest.name === "string" ? manifest.name : "";
const pluginId = pkgName ? unscopedPackageName(pkgName) : "plugin";

The pluginId is derived from package.json name, never consulting clawdbot.plugin.json id field.
