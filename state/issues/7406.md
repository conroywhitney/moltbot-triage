## Description

## Summary

Session dropdown shows raw keys like `agent:main:telegram:group:-123456789:topic:42` instead of human-readable topic names for Telegram forum topics.

## Expected Behavior

Display as `Telegram : GroupName : TopicName` (with spaces around colons, preserving original casing) instead of raw numeric IDs.

## Solution

- Capture topic name from `forum_topic_created` service messages in Telegram
- Store `topicName` in session metadata  
- Display formatted name in session list with spaced colons

**Note:** This is Telegram-specific. Other platforms may have different formatting needs.
