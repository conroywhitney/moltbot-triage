## Description

**Type:** Documentation / Developer Experience (DX) / Bug?
**OpenClaw Version:** 2026.1.30

## Context
During a manual setup of OpenClaw on Windows 11 using a WSL2 (Ubuntu) backend, we encountered several friction points that might discourage or confuse new users.

## Friction Points

### 1. Strict `gateway.bind` Validation
The CLI schema validation (Zod) specifically rejects IP literals like `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0` in favor of `loopback` or `lan`.
- **Observed Error**: `Invalid config at ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json: - gateway.bind: Invalid input`
- **Expected Behavior**: Allow standard IP literals or provide a more descriptive error message within the CLI itself explaining the move to logical identifiers (`loopback`/`lan`). Forcing logical identifiers breaks the "standard" dev-environment setup flow.

### 2. Configuration Schema for `agents.defaults.model`
Manual configuration of the agent model often leads to a failure if a string is provided instead of the required object structure.
- **Requirement**: `{ "agents": { "defaults": { "model": { "primary": "model-id" } } } }`
- **Confusion**: Many users expect a top-level string for simplicity. The error message when this is missing is not always intuitive regarding the nested structure required.

### 3. "Device Identity Required" on WSL2/LAN access
Accessing the Control UI via a LAN IP (standard for WSL2 users who can't use `localhost` across the bridge easily) triggers a security context check that requires `WebCrypto`.
- **Impact**: Browser blocks identity generation over insecure (non-HTTPS) LAN IPs, leading to a persistent "device identity required" error.
- **Suggestion**:
    - Add a first-class hint in the `openclaw status` or `logs` when `gateway.bind: lan` is detected, warning user about the insecure context and suggesting `?token=...` or `allowInsecureAuth: true`.
    - Improve documentation regarding the "WSL2 -> Windows Host" networking bridge which often forces a non-localhost access.

### 4. RAM Management / Ollama Failures
When running local models (e.g., Llama 3.2 3B) on machines with limited RAM (e.g., 16GB total), Ollama can fail silently or allocate too much memory.
- **Mitigation used**: We created a custom model with reduced `num_ctx` (4096) and `num_predict` (2048) to fit within a ~13 GiB free RAM window.
- **Suggestion**: Provide a "Low RAM" optimization preset or documentation for Ollama-based local setups.

## Proposed Resolution
- Relax Zod schema for `gateway.bind` to accept common IP literals.
- Update `openclaw doctor` to check for secure contexts when bound to `lan`.
- Update onboarding docs with a "WSL2 Guide".
