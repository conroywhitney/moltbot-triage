## Description

When accessing webchat via Tailscale Serve with `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: true`, I still have to manually approve device pairing every time my browser's localStorage gets cleared.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: I need to approve pairing from another session (TUI, Telegram, etc.) before I can use webchat — which defeats the purpose of webchat being a quick access point.

## Current behavior

   - `allowTailscale: true` skips token auth for Tailscale Serve requests ✓
   - Device pairing still requires manual approval via `clawdbot devices approve` ✗

## Proposed solution

Add a config option to auto-approve device pairing when the request comes from Tailscale Serve with valid identity headers:

   ```json
   {
     "gateway": {
       "devices": {
         "autoApprove": "tailscale"  // options: "none" | "tailscale" | "all"
       }
     }
   }
 ```

## Rationale

Tailscale Serve already provides strong identity guarantees via tailscale-user-login headers. If I trust Tailscale enough to skip token auth, I should be able to trust it for device pairing too.

🔗 **Implementation:** PR #3814 implements this feature - adds device auto-approve policy specifically for Tailscale connections.
