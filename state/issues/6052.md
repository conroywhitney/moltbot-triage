## Description

#The Problem:
The "QuickStart" and "Manual" modes are both fundamentally broken for local-first users. The CLI (v2026.1.30) suffers from aggressive "Claude-Opus" hijacking and a pedantic JSON5 parser that makes initial setup nearly impossible.
Specific Failures:
Model Hijacking: Even when agents.defaults is manually set to ollama/llama3.1, the gateway reverts to anthropic/claude-opus-4-5 on every boot (someone must be getting a nice kickback!!)
Broken Schema Validation: The config set command rejects its own keys (e.g., reference, endpoint, providers, provider) as "Unrecognized," despite the doctor command demanding them.
Fragile Parser: The JSON5 parser throws syntax errors for standard macOS file paths and unescaped characters that doctor --fix should handle but doesn't.
Channel Logic: Telegram is marked as "Unsupported" or "Not Configured" even when a valid botToken is provided in the config.
Ghost Processes: The gateway frequently locks port 18789 and fails to stop via openclaw gateway stop, requiring manual kill -9 commands.
M4/Apple Silicon UX is trash: On the most powerful consumer AI hardware available, your program spends more time printing "funny" ASCII art than connecting to a local Ollama instance. Fix the configuration inheritance and stop forcing cloud models on local users (after all it is open source and users don't care for the over aggressive hijack to force Claude_Opus, I'm sure the kickbacks are nice but seriously leave it at the front door, or be transparent and let all users know the real truth behind it which is probably part of your litigation with anthropic, right Peter??)

Lets do a better job and fix it, Peter Steinberger!!
