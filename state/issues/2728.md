## Description

## Summary
The "brew not installed" error occurred because the Clawdbot CLI (running on Windows) was trying to use brew (a Mac/Linux tool) to install skills.

## Proposed solution

1. Support Windows Config: Added winget and scoop as supported installation methods.
2. Fix GitHub Skill: Configured the GitHub skill to use winget on Windows.
3. Prevent Errors: Added logic to explicitly ignore brew installers when running on Windo
