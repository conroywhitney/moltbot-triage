## Description

When heartbeat triggers and the agent responds with status text (instead of just HEARTBEAT_OK), the response is sent to the last active WhatsApp channel - which is often a customer conversation.

This causes internal status messages like "Revisando estado actual: pedido cancelado..." to be delivered directly to customers.

Expected behavior: Heartbeat responses should be internal-only and never routed to customer channels.

Workaround: Disabled heartbeat with clawdbot system heartbeat disable
