## Description

## Problem

The current file-based memory system relies on trust — the agent *choosing* to read the right files at the right time. This creates several failure modes:

1. **Files grow → things get buried** — important rules sink to the bottom
2. **Context windows are limited** — can't read everything every turn
3. **No guarantee the right file is read at the right moment** — agent may forget to check
4. **"I'll remember" is meaningless** — if it's not written AND read, it's forgotten

Saying "I'll remember" or "noted" provides false confidence when there's no enforcement mechanism.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Mandatory Pre-flight Check (RULES.md)
Before every response, automatically scan a `RULES.md` file (or similar). This would contain hard constraints the agent must never forget — injected by Clawdbot, not by the agent's choice.

### 2. Smaller, Role-specific Files
Instead of one large `MEMORY.md`, support structured files like:
- `rules/dont-do.md` — things to never do
- `rules/always-do.md` — mandatory behaviors
- `rules/preferences.md` — user preferences

Smaller files are easier to load completely and less likely to have important content truncated.

### 3. Embedding Search on Every Response
Currently `memory_search` is optional and agent-initiated. Consider automatic semantic search on every turn to surface relevant memories without relying on the agent to remember to search.

### 4. Hard Constraints in System Prompt
Critical rules should be injected into the system prompt by Clawdbot itself, not left to the agent to read from files. This makes them truly unforgettable.

## Context

This came up in discussion about agents making promises they can't keep because there's no enforcement mechanism. The current system works for simple stuff but breaks for repeated behavioral issues.
