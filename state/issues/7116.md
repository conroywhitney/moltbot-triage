## Description

# Summary

Telegram integration fails to detect or process PDF files sent as document attachments — the bot responds as if no PDF was received (e.g., "can't find the PDF file" / "hasn't received any PDF file"), even though the file is successfully sent and appears in the chat.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Ensure OpenClaw (Clawdbot version 2026.1.30) is running with Telegram integration configured and the bot is online/connected.
2. In the Telegram chat with the bot, tap the attachment/paperclip icon → File (or Document) → select and send a PDF file. (Important: Send as **Document**, not as Photo if Telegram offers preview options.)
3. Optionally include a caption/prompt like "Summarize this PDF" or "Read this document" — or send the file standalone.
4. Wait for the bot's response (usually quick).

## Expected behavior

The bot should:
- Receive and acknowledge the document attachment.
- Download the file via Telegram API (getFile + download).
- Process it (e.g., extract text via OCR/PDF parser, summarize, store in context, or respond based on your prompt/skill).
- Reply with relevant output or confirmation (e.g., "Got the PDF — here's a summary...").

## Actual behavior

The bot ignores/does not detect the PDF attachment entirely. It replies with error-like messages indicating no file was received (variants include "I can't find the PDF file", "I haven't received any PDF file", or similar denial), despite Telegram confirming successful delivery to the bot.

No processing occurs; the file seems dropped before reaching the agent's context or any PDF-handling skill.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30 (post-rebrand from Clawdbot/Moltbot; confirm via `openclaw --version` or logs if the binary/CLI updated naming)
- OS: Latest Ubuntu LTS (24.04)
- Install method: From source (git clone + build/install steps, presumably following https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw README or docs)
