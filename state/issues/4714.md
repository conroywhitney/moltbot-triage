## Description

## Summary
A generic event-driven trigger system that executes actions when specific events occur.

## Use Case
- When a new Discord channel is created → automatically add it to config
- When specific keywords are mentioned → trigger custom actions  
- When a reaction is added → execute workflows (e.g., pin message)

## Current State
- Only time-based triggers available (cron, heartbeat)
- No event-driven automation
- Manual config updates required for new channels

## Proposed Solution
```yaml
triggers:
  - event: discord.channel_create
    action: config.patch
    template: |
      {"channels":{"discord":{"guilds":{"{{guild_id}}":{"channels":{"{{channel_id}}":{"enabled":true}}}}}}}
  
  - event: discord.reaction_add
    filter: 
      emoji: "📌"
    action: message.pin
```

## Benefits
- IFTTT/n8n-like automation within Clawdbot
- Reduce manual config updates
- Enable powerful event-driven workflows
- Keep automations close to the agent (no external dependencies)

## Additional Context
Currently using Clawdbot with Discord, managing 20+ channels. Every time a new channel is created, manual config.patch is required. An event trigger system would streamline this significantly.
