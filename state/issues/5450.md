## Description

## Summary

What went wrong?

After running the docker-setup.sh script, any attempt to select a channel (e.g., Telegram, Discord, etc.) during the onboarding process fails with a configuration validation error. The system claims the plugin cannot be found, even though the files exist in the source directory.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the repository on Ubuntu 22.04.
2. Run the ./docker-setup.sh (or the provided setup script).
3. Follow the interactive onboarding process.
4. When prompted to "Select channel," choose any provider (e.g., Telegram).

## Expected behavior

What did you expect to happen?

The selected channel should be validated and configured successfully, allowing the onboarding to proceed to the next step.

## Actual behavior

What actually happened?

The process terminates with the following error message: Error: Config validation failed: plugins.entries.telegram: plugin not found: telegram (Note: This happens regardless of which channel is selected.)

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: Latest (Main branch) (commit: 59cfff02f)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): Docker

## Logs or screenshots

Error: Config validation failed: plugins.entries.telegram: plugin not found: telegram

Paste relevant logs or add screenshots (redact secrets).
