## Description

## Summary
Open source LLMs lets us have privacy, but tends to make mistakes(often in loops). 

## Proposed solution
Add a feature where a stronger LLM can verify the answer of weaker llm on important tasks. This happens in a way that the stronger LLM will not have access to any sensitive data from the computer. This might be a good setup for privacy focused individuals. If it works well, we might be able to do more with local llms, with a proprietary one verifying.

## Problems with my approach
- Latency: This will create additional overhead, which will slow the whole action. So, this have to be done only on very important actions. We will have to design a way to figure out which actions need this (shell scripts/ deletion/ etc.)
- Stronger LLMs need context: Many situations will require the stronger LLM to have more context (which might need sensitive information). We will need to find a way to solve this without giving sensitive information. (Maybe send metadata, but that too might not be enough)

Is this a good idea?
