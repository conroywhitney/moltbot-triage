## Description

When trying to install @openclaw/msteams (both latest 2026.2.1 and older 2026.1.29), the installation fails consistently. This occurs both when using openclaw plugins install and when attempting a direct npm install.

The verbose npm install log shows a consistent EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL error, indicating an unresolved workspace:* dependency reference was published in the package's dependencies. This makes the msteams plugin completely unusable for new installations.

Verbose NPM Log:

npm verbose cli /opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/25.5.0/bin/node /opt/homebrew/bin/npm
npm info using npm@11.8.0
npm info using node@v25.5.0
...
npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
...
Environment:

OS: macOS Sonoma (arm64)
Node: v25.5.0
NPM: v11.8.0
