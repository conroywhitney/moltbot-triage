## Description

## Summary

What went wrong?

I cant use gemini cli O Auth, when i send a request, it stays completely silent, and after a few minutes answers with "This version of Antigravity is no longer supported. Please update to receive the latest features!". Antigravity O Auth does the same, but instanlty. 

Important  note: "This version of Antigravity..." message appears only in telegram, in terminal ui it gust displays "No output" 

I use the latest version of openclaw (2026.1.29) 

## Steps to reproduce

1. Message openclaw while Gemini CLI model is used
2. Wait about 10 minutes
3. Observe "This version of...." in telegram and "No output" in terminal UI

## Expected behavior

Model answers my request.

## Actual behavior

"This version of Antigravity is no longer supported." error appears in telegram and "No output" in terminal UI.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.29 (a5b4d22)
- OS: MacOS
- Install method: Universal one liner for linux and macOS

## Comments

### @huahuayu (2026-02-01)

**Workaround**: This issue is caused by a hardcoded outdated User-Agent version (`1.15.8`) in the `@mariozechner/pi-ai` dependency.

Until it's fixed upstream, you can manually patch the file:

```bash
# Find and replace the outdated version
sed -i 's/antigravity\/1.15.8/antigravity\/1.15.9/g' $(npm root)/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-ai/dist/providers/google-gemini-cli.js

# Restart your service after patching
```

I've reported this upstream at https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1129
