## Description

## Description

In Telegram threaded mode, natural chat replies (non-tool responses) are being sent with empty message bodies, causing:

```
telegram sendMessage failed: (400: Bad Request: message text is empty)
telegram final reply failed: GrammyError: message text is empty
```

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- Channel: Telegram
- Mode: Threaded sessions (thread-per-topic)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Enable Telegram with threaded mode
2. Start a conversation in a thread
3. Have the agent respond naturally (not via `message` tool)
4. Response fails with empty text error

## Expected Behavior
Agent's natural replies should be captured and sent correctly to threads.

## Actual Behavior
The reply text is empty by the time it reaches the Telegram API, causing a 400 error.

## Workaround
Using the `message` tool explicitly with `replyTo` works correctly. Only natural chat responses fail.

## Logs
