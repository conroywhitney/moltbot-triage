## Description

## Environment
- Version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux (x64)

## Description
All `sessions_spawn` calls fail immediately with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')
```

## Reproduction
1. Call `sessions_spawn` with any task
2. Session is accepted but fails within 1-2 seconds
3. No output, just the trim error

## Notes
- Cron-based isolated sessions work fine (same agents run successfully via cron)
- Only `sessions_spawn` tool is affected
- Happens with simple tasks too (e.g., 'Say hello')

## Workaround
Using cron jobs instead of direct session spawning.
