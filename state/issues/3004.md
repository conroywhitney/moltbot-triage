## Description

## Summary
When using Clawdbot with a Claude Max subscription (via token auth), users have no visibility into their remaining rate limit allocation (the 5-hour rolling window).

## Problem
- Claude Max has usage limits that reset every 5 hours
- The Claude CLI shows warnings like "50% remaining" when approaching limits
- The API returns `anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-remaining` and `anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-limit` headers
- Clawdbot's `/status` and `session_status` don't expose these values
- Users can be surprised when they hit limits mid-conversation

## Requested Feature
Please expose the rate limit headers from API responses in:
1. `/status` command output
2. `session_status` tool response
3. Optionally, a warning when remaining drops below a threshold (e.g., 20%)

## Example output
```
🦞 Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
🧠 Model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
📊 Max Plan: 65% remaining (resets in 3h 12m)  <-- NEW
📚 Context: 142k/200k (71%)
```

## Additional context
This would help users:
- Plan their usage throughout the day
- Avoid unexpected cutoffs during important work
- Make informed decisions about when to use Opus vs Sonnet

Thanks! 🦞
