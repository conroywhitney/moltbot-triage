## Description

## Description
The Slack channel plugin is missing two quality-of-life features that Discord already has:

1. **Typing indicator** - Show "..." typing indicator when the bot is responding
2. **Auto-reactions** - Automatically react to user messages (thumbs up, etc.)

## Expected Behavior
- When the assistant is thinking/responding, show typing indicator in Slack
- Allow automatic reactions to user messages (e.g., 👍 for acknowledgment)

## Current Workaround
None - these features are not implemented

## Additional Context
- Discord plugin already has these features
- Slack API supports both typing indicator (`typing` event) and reactions (`reactions.add`)

## Possible Implementation
- Use Slack's `typing` API endpoint to send typing indicator during long responses
- Add config option for auto-reactions on user messages

Environment:
- OpenClaw version: latest
- Platform: macOS
- Channel: Slack DM
