## Description

## Summary

The `interruptOnSpeech` setting in Talk Mode config does not appear to stop TTS playback when the user starts speaking.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable Talk Mode on macOS
2. Ensure `talk.interruptOnSpeech` is set to `true` in config
3. Ask the assistant something that produces a long response
4. While the assistant is speaking (TTS playback), start talking
5. Expected: TTS playback should stop
6. Actual: TTS continues playing

## Expected Behavior

Per the docs (`nodes/talk.md`):
> **Interrupt on speech** (default on): if the user starts talking while the assistant is speaking, we stop playback and note the interruption timestamp for the next prompt.

TTS playback should stop when user speech is detected.

## Actual Behavior

TTS playback continues even when the user speaks. The interrupt does not trigger.

## Config

```json
{
  "talk": {
    "modelId": "eleven_v3",
    "apiKey": "[redacted]",
    "interruptOnSpeech": true
  }
}
```

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Platform: macOS (MacBook Air)
- App version: 2026.1.30 (8469)

## Notes

Possible causes:
- Speech detection threshold may be too high
- Audio pipeline issue preventing mic input during playback
- VAD (voice activity detection) not triggering correctly
