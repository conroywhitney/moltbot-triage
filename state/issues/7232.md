## Description

## Description

Pressing ESC in the webchat interface does not stop the model from generating a response.

## Expected behavior

ESC should interrupt the generation immediately (both UI and server-side).

## Current behavior

ESC may stop the UI display, but the server continues processing tokens.

## Environment

- Interface: Webchat
- OS: macOS

## Additional context

This wastes tokens/quota when the user wants to cancel a response mid-generation.

## Comments

### @ceo648 (2026-02-02)

**Additional bug:** User reports that sometimes their own messages appear as if the assistant wrote them, or messages get duplicated/attributed incorrectly in the webchat interface. This is a separate UI rendering issue that should be investigated alongside the ESC key problem.
