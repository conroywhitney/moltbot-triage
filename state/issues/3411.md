## Description

## Summary
Dashboard shows skill as "blocked" despite being installed via Go and working correctly at runtime. CLI `clawdbot skills` shows it as "✓ ready".

## Steps to reproduce
1. Install a skill's required binary via Go (`go install github.com/steipete/wacli/cmd/wacli@latest`)
2. Ensure the Go bin path is in `$PATH` and/or `tools.exec.pathPrepend` in config
3. Check skill status in web dashboard vs `clawdbot skills` CLI

## Expected behavior
Dashboard skill status should match CLI output — skill should show as "ready" since the binary is installed and functional.

## Actual behavior
Dashboard shows skill as "blocked" while CLI shows "✓ ready". The skill works fine at runtime (exec tool finds and uses it).

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux (Raspberry Pi, arm64)
- Install method: npm global

## Logs or screenshots
```
# CLI shows ready:
clawdbot skills
✓ ready   │ 📱 wacli │ ...

# Binary exists and works:
which wacli
/home/admin/go/bin/wacli

# Config has pathPrepend:
"tools": { "exec": { "pathPrepend": ["/home/admin/go/bin"] } }
```

Dashboard shows "blocked" for wacli (screenshot if available).
