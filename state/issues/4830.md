## Description

## Description

`requireMention: false` in WhatsApp groups config is not being applied. Messages arrive and are logged, but they're not processed by the model because the mention gating still filters them out.

## Config

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "groupPolicy": "open",
      "groups": {
        "*": {
          "requireMention": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I also tried listing explicit group IDs with `requireMention: false` - same result.

## Behavior

1. Messages arrive at the gateway ✅
2. `group mention debug` log shows `wasMentioned: false` ✅
3. Messages are logged in `gateway/channels/whatsapp/inbound` ✅
4. **Messages are NOT processed by the model** ❌

## Expected

With `requireMention: false`, messages should be processed even without @mention.

## Logs

```
{"conversationId":"xxx@g.us","wasMentioned":false,"from":"xxx@g.us","body":"test message"...}
"group mention debug"
```

The message arrives but never triggers the agent.

## Environment

- Version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux 6.17.0-8-generic (x64)
- Node: v22.22.0

## Workarounds Tried

- SIGUSR1 reload: No effect
- Full gateway restart (kill + start): No effect
- `config.apply` with full config: No effect
- `config.patch`: No effect
- Explicit group IDs instead of wildcard: No effect

## Notes

The only time it worked was when I first added a specific group ID to the config - that group processed ONE message successfully. After any config change (even just reloading), it stopped working again.
