## Description

Problem:
When openrouter/auto is used, the specific model it resolves to is not exposed to the agent, hindering accurate reporting to the user.

Requested Change:
Please ensure the actual model name resolved by openrouter/auto and its cost is accessible to the agent. This would enable reporting in the format [Resolved Model Name] (Auto) (e.g., Gemini Flash (Auto)) in the footer of each response along with its cost.

Benefit:
Increases transparency and user trust by accurately reflecting the specific model in use when the Auto is selected, rather than just openrouter/auto.
