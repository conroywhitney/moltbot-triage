## Description

## Summary

Need the agent's brain saved up in a personal repository. When its body dies, I can transfer its mind back. 

Note: my secrets must not be in there

## Proposed solution

**Save path**
- configure workspace to be synced up
- each identity (including memory) change is committed with an explicit message
- commits are pushed

**Restoration**
- The CLI can restore instead of onboarding

## Alternatives considered

I had it configured manually. It's cumbersome. The agent keeps forgetting to commit and push.

I'm not sure that we want to build a Cylon ;-)
