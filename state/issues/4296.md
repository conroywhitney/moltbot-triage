## Description

The bot has been losing context, seemingly crashing, and saving information into a 20205 memory file instead of 2026.

`clawdbot --version: Version: 2026.1.24-3`

`date: Thu Jan 29 20:12:57 EST 2026`

`ls -la ~/clawd/memory/:total 16
drwxr-xr-x   4 nessbot  staff   128 Jan 29 01:28 .
drwxr-xr-x  29 nessbot  staff   928 Jan 29 12:15 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 nessbot  staff   347 Jan 29 02:10 2026-01-28.md
-rw-r--r--   1 nessbot  staff  1145 Jan 29 04:00 2026-01-29.md`

Evidence:
`Error: ENOENT: access '/Users/nessbot/clawd/memory/2025-01-29.md'
Error: ENOENT: access '/Users/nessbot/clawd/memory/2025-01-28.md'`

Reality: 

`$ ls ~/clawd/memory/
2026-01-28.md  (exists)
2026-01-29.md  (exists)`

from logs:
