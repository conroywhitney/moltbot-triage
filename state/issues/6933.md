## Description

### Description

When attempting to log in to ClawHub via the CLI (`clawhub login`), the authentication flow fails with an `Unauthorized` error, even after the browser successfully completes the GitHub OAuth flow and shows the 'Auth Worked' message.

This persists when manually providing a token via `clawhub login --token <token>`.

### Environment

- **OS**: macOS 15.2.0 (arm64)
- **OpenClaw Version**: 2026.1.30
- **ClawHub CLI**: v0.4.0
- **Architecture**: Darwin 25.2.0

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `clawhub login`
2. Complete GitHub auth in browser
3. Observe `✖ Unauthorized` in terminal

**Alternatively:**
1. Generate an API token at `https://clawhub.ai`
2. Run `clawhub login --token <your-token>`
3. Observe `✖ Unauthorized`

### Analysis

Checking the local `config.json` (`~/Library/Application Support/clawhub/config.json`), the registry was initially set to `https://clawhub.com`. Updating this manually to `https://clawhub.ai` did not resolve the issue.

The CLI appears to be hitting `https://clawhub.ai/api/cli/whoami`, which returns a 401/Unauthorized for freshly generated tokens. This may be related to the recent domain migration from `.com` to `.ai`.
