## Description

## Summary
Canvas node commands (snapshot, hide, eval, etc.) use a 10-second default timeout which is often too short, especially for initial canvas renders or when the node needs time to initialize.

## Reproduction
1. Present a canvas on a node
2. Immediately attempt a snapshot
3. Command times out before canvas finishes rendering

## Current behavior
```
gateway timeout after 10000ms
Gateway target: ws://127.0.0.1:18789
```

## Expected behavior
Either:
1. Increase the default timeout to 30s for canvas commands
2. Make the default configurable via `tools.canvas.defaultTimeoutMs` or similar
3. Document the `timeoutMs` parameter more prominently

## Workaround
Passing `timeoutMs: 30000` to canvas commands works:
```
canvas action:snapshot node:<id> timeoutMs:30000
```

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.23
- Node: Mac Studio (macOS 26.3.0)
- Gateway: local loopback
