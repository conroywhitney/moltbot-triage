## Description

**Problem:**
Long sessions are a core Clawdbot strength (compaction, memory files, heartbeats support this). However, workspace files (AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, etc.) are only injected at session start. In multi-hour sessions, when a user requests new work, the agent may not have the latest SOPs/context from those files unless it manually re-reads them — which is unreliable.

**Impact:**
- Agents skip critical SOPs (e.g., "check Kanban board before starting work")
- Memory context becomes stale in long sessions
- Users must either:
  - Start a new session for each task (defeats the purpose of long sessions)
  - Manually prompt "check your SOPs" (error-prone, adds friction)

**Proposed Solution:**
Add config option to force workspace file re-reads:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      workspace: "~/clawd",
      reloadWorkspaceFiles: {
        enabled: true,
        trigger: "message",  // message | idle | interval
        idleThresholdMinutes: 30,  // for trigger=idle
        intervalMinutes: 60,  // for trigger=interval
        files: ["AGENTS.md", "MEMORY.md"]  // or "*" for all
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternatives:**
1. `trigger: "message"` — Re-read before every user message (most reliable, slight token cost)
2. `trigger: "idle"` — Re-read after N minutes of inactivity (balances freshness + cost)
3. `trigger: "interval"` — Re-read every N minutes (predictable token burn)

**Use Case:**
AGENTS.md contains a "START HERE" checklist for every work request. Without automatic re-reads, the agent must remember to manually read it — which fails under cognitive load.

**Workarounds (current):**
- Manual "check your SOPs" prompts from user
- Disciplined agent behavior (unreliable)
- Starting new sessions frequently (defeats long-session design)

**Context:**
This came up during a real workflow issue where the agent skipped Kanban board updates mid-session because AGENTS.md wasn't re-read before starting new work. Long sessions are valuable (hours/days), but workspace file staleness creates reliability issues.
