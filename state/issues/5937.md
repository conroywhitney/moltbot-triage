## Description

## Bug Report: Google Antigravity models only respond via Telegram/Web channels

**OpenClaw Version:** 2026.1.30 (76b5208)
**Platform:** Linux Mint (Ubuntu-based)
**Provider:** google-antigravity

## Summary

Google Antigravity models work correctly when messages are sent from Telegram or the web portal, but hang indefinitely when initiated from the local terminal or Control UI.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Install Google Antigravity and authenticate with Google account
2. OpenClaw auto-detects auth and adds to `auth-profiles.json`
3. Configure Antigravity models in `openclaw.json`:
   ```json
   "models": {
     "google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking": {},
     "google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash": {}
   }
   ```
4. Send message from **Telegram** → ✅ Works
5. Send message from **Web portal** → ✅ Works  
6. Send message from **local terminal** → ❌ Hangs forever
7. Send message from **Control UI** → ❌ Hangs forever

## Expected Behavior

Antigravity models should respond regardless of which channel initiates the request.

## Actual Behavior

- ✅ Telegram channel: responses work immediately
- ✅ Web portal: responses work immediately
- ❌ Local terminal: request hangs, no response
- ❌ Control UI: request hangs, no response

## Tested Fixes (None Worked)

- Killing the Antigravity desktop application
- Restarting the OpenClaw gateway
- Sending a "warm-up" message from Telegram first, then trying terminal

## Configuration

**auth-profiles.json:**
```json
"google-antigravity:user@gmail.com": {
  "type": "oauth",
  "provider": "google-antigravity",
  "access": "ya29...",
  "refresh": "1//...",
  "expires": 1769920114693,
  "email": "user@gmail.com",
  "projectId": "..."
}
```

**lastGood shows the profile is recognized:**
```json
"lastGood": {
  "google-antigravity": "google-antigravity:user@gmail.com"
}
```

## Notes

- This differs from #1402 - tokens ARE being used (Telegram works)
- The issue seems specific to how local channels initialize the provider vs remote channels
- Practical workaround: Use Telegram for Antigravity models

## Comments

### @mark9232 (2026-02-01)

**Additional clarification on channel behavior:**

The web portal DOES work for sending messages to Antigravity models. However, responses sent via the web portal don't appear in Telegram - each channel receives its own responses independently.

So the full picture is:
- ✅ **Telegram**: Can send and receive
- ✅ **Web portal**: Can send and receive (but responses stay in web portal only)
- ❌ **Local terminal**: Hangs, no response
- ❌ **Control UI**: Hangs, no response

Channels share conversation history, but responses are routed back to the originating channel only.

### @mark9232 (2026-02-01)

**More detail on cross-channel visibility:**

When communicating via Telegram:
- ✅ Messages and responses show up in the **web portal** (shared history)
- ❌ Messages and responses do NOT show up in the **terminal**

So the terminal appears to be isolated from the conversation history entirely when using Antigravity models, while Telegram and web portal share visibility.
