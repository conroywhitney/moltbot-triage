## Description

## Summary
Moltbot randomly disconnects with WebSocket close code (1006) without any reason or error message, even though the installation is stable and unchanged.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Install Moltbot globally using npm.
2. Start Moltbot normally.
3. Let it run for a while (idle or active).
4. Observe that it suddenly disconnects with code (1006).

## Expected behavior
The bot should maintain a stable connection, or at least provide a clear error reason when a disconnect happens.

## Actual behavior
The connection drops unexpectedly with:
`disconnected (1006): no reason`

No additional logs or explanation are provided.

## Environment
- Clawdbot / Moltbot version: Latest official release + occurs in beta release as well
- OS: macOS (Intel)
- Install method: npm (global install)

## Logs or screenshots
No explicit error logs — disconnect happens silently with code (1006).
