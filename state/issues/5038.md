## Description

## Problem

The exec approval prompt in the macOS app says "Review the command details before allowing" but **doesn't actually show the command being requested**.

## Screenshot

The prompt shows:
- "Allow this command?"
- "Review the command details before allowing."
- Three buttons: Allow Once / Always Allow / Don't Allow

But there's no indication of what command is being requested. Users are asked to approve something blind.

## Expected Behavior

The prompt should display:
- The actual command (e.g., `whoami` or `ls -la /some/path`)
- Ideally the requesting agent/session
- Maybe the working directory

## Impact

- "Ask" mode is effectively useless for security review
- "Always Allow" is dangerous when you can't see what you're allowing
- Users can't make informed decisions about command approval

## Environment

- macOS app version 2026.1.29
- Exec approvals set to "ask" mode
