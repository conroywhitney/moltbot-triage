## Description

### Description

The WhatsApp channel on Windows 10 is experiencing persistent and cyclical connectivity problems. After a successful QR code link, the channel works for one or two messages and then fails with a "No active WhatsApp Web listener" error. Subsequent attempts to send messages fail, and troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue reliably.

### Environment

*   **OS:** Windows 10
*   **OpenClaw Version:** (Please fill in if you know it)
*   **Channel:** WhatsApp

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Link a WhatsApp account using the QR code flow.
2.  The gateway reports "WhatsApp gateway connected."
3.  Successfully send one message from OpenClaw to WhatsApp.
4.  Attempt to send a second message.
5.  The command fails.

### Expected Behavior

The WhatsApp connection should remain stable and allow for continuous message sending without frequent disconnects or errors.

### Actual Behavior

-   After one successful message, subsequent messages fail with: `Error: No active WhatsApp Web listener (account: default)`.
-   The system log shows a `WhatsApp gateway disconnected (status 401)` message, suggesting an authentication problem.
-   Troubleshooting attempts lead to an inconsistent state:
    -   Running `whatsapp_login start` reports `WhatsApp is already linked`.
    -   Attempting to force a relink or logout does not consistently clear the state.
    -   Restarting the OpenClaw gateway temporarily shows a "connected" status, but the error reappears on the next message attempt.

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken

-   Multiple QR code scans.
-   Restarting the OpenClaw gateway multiple times.
-   Enabling `commands.restart: true` in `openclaw.json`.
-   Attempting `openclaw channels logout --channel whatsapp`.
-   Attempting a forced relink, which timed out.

This behavior makes the WhatsApp channel currently unusable on this Windows 10 setup.
