## Description

## Description
The logo in the Gateway Dashboard header shows a broken image icon instead of the OpenClaw logo.

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat

## Expected behavior
The OpenClaw logo should display in the header.

## Actual behavior
A broken image placeholder is shown. The logo path returns HTML (200 OK, Content-Type: text/html) instead of the actual image file.

## Investigation
Logo files exist at:
- `/docs/assets/openclaw-logo-text.png`
- `/docs/assets/openclaw-logo-text-dark.png`

But the dashboard appears to reference a path that doesn't serve these files correctly.

I addressed this issue in PR #7178
If you have some time, I’d really appreciate it if you could take a look.

### @arosstale (2026-02-02)

Thanks for the detailed bug report! PR #7178 provides an elegant fix to this issue:

**The Problem:**
The header logo was hardcoded to request `/favicon.svg`, which ignored the `gateway.controlUi.basePath` configuration. When a base path was set (e.g., `/ui`, `/openclaw`), the logo request failed because it attempted to access outside the configured path, resulting in a broken image placeholder.

**The Solution:**
The fix updates the logo URL generation to dynamically use `state.basePath`, ensuring the request goes to the correct path. This aligns the header logo with how all other UI assets (JS, CSS, avatars) are already being served, maintaining consistency across the application.

**Status:**
All CI checks passing |  No conflicts with main branch | Ready to merge

This resolves the issue for anyone using `gateway.controlUi.basePath`. Excellent catch! 👍
