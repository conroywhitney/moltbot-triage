## Description

## Bug Description

When a Slack user replies to a thread with **"Also send as direct message"** (aka "Also send to channel") checked, Slack sends the event with `subtype: "thread_broadcast"`. 

Currently, Clawdbot only logs a system event notification and **returns early without processing the message**:

```javascript
// dist/slack/monitor/events/messages.js
if (message.subtype === "thread_broadcast") {
    // ... validation ...
    enqueueSystemEvent(`Slack thread reply broadcast in ${label}.`, { ... });
    return;  // ← Message is never processed!
}
```

This means the actual message content is dropped and the bot never responds.

## Expected Behavior

Thread broadcast messages should be processed like regular messages, routed to the appropriate thread session.

## Reproduction

1. Start a thread conversation with Clawdbot in Slack
2. Reply to the thread with "Also send as direct message" checked
3. Observe that Clawdbot does not respond (only a system event is logged)

## Suggested Fix

Call `handleSlackMessage()` for thread_broadcast messages:

```javascript
if (message.subtype === "thread_broadcast") {
    await handleSlackMessage(message, { source: "message" });
    return;
}
```

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Slack Socket Mode
