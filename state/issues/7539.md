## Description

## Summary
After changing the primary model in `openclaw.json`, existing sessions remain stuck on the old model (in my case `delivery-mirror`), causing empty responses in the Chat UI.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Have an active session running with model A
2. Change `model.primary` in `openclaw.json` to model B
3. Restart gateway (`pkill -USR1 openclaw-gateway` or `openclaw gateway restart`)
4. Send a message in the existing session via Chat UI

## Expected Behavior
Session should pick up the new model from config after gateway restart.

## Actual Behavior
- Session remains stuck on old model (`delivery-mirror` in my case)
- Agent runs and completes (logs show `run_completed` with duration)
- But response text is empty in the UI
- `openclaw sessions list` shows the session still using the old model

## Workaround
Delete the stuck session file manually:
```bash
rm ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl
openclaw gateway restart
```
Then create a new session.

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- macOS
- Gateway mode: local

## Additional Context
The CLI works fine (`openclaw agent --message "hi"` returns proper response), confirming the config is correct. Only the persisted session in the UI was affected.
