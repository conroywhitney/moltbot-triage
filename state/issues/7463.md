## Description

## Problem

When using `sessions_send` via Gateway API `/tools/invoke`, the "agent-to-agent announce step" always triggers, even when trying to disable it. This causes unintended cross-agent communication.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- Setup: Multiple agents (Elma, Plana) with separate Gateway instances

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up two agents: Elma (default, port 18789) and Plana (dedicated Gateway, port 18810)
2. Call `sessions_send` from webhook server to Plana's session via Plana's dedicated Gateway (port 18810)
3. Plana responds correctly to the target channel
4. **Issue**: Elma also receives an "agent-to-agent announce step" and posts to the same channel

## What I Tried

1. **Separate Gateway for Plana** (port 18810 with dedicated config)
   - Result: Announce still happens

2. **Set `agentToAgent.enabled: false` in plana.json**
   ```json
   "session": {
     "scope": "per-sender",
     "agentToAgent": {
       "enabled": false
     }
   }
   ```
   - Result: Announce still happens

3. **Add `announce: false` to sessions_send args**
   ```json
   {
     "tool": "sessions_send",
     "agentId": "plana",
     "args": {
       "sessionKey": "agent:plana:discord:channel:xxx",
       "message": "...",
       "timeoutSeconds": 60,
       "announce": false
     }
   }
   ```
   - Result: Announce still happens

## Expected Behavior

There should be a way to disable the agent-to-agent announce step when calling `sessions_send`, especially when:
- Using a dedicated Gateway for a specific agent
- Explicitly setting `agentToAgent.enabled: false`
- Passing `announce: false` in the tool args

## Actual Behavior

The announce step always triggers, causing the default agent (Elma) to post messages like:
```
This is an agent-to-agent announce step. My previous message was...
```

## Workaround

Currently considering bypassing `sessions_send` entirely and using Discord API directly, but this loses the benefit of OpenClaw's session management.

## Feature Request

Please add a reliable way to disable the announce step, such as:
- `announce: false` option in `sessions_send` args
- Per-agent or per-Gateway setting to disable announce
- Clear documentation on how to prevent cross-agent announces
