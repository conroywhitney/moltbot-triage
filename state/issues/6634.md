## Description

## Summary

When using the webchat interface, tool call results (JSON output, exec results, etc.) are displayed inline, making the conversation cluttered and hard to follow.

## Current behavior

All tool calls and their full output are shown expanded in the webchat, e.g.:
- Raw JSON from API calls
- Full exec command output
- Internal function results

## Requested behavior

Add an option to hide or collapse tool call output in webchat, similar to how Telegram filters it out. Possible implementations:

1. **Config option** (e.g., `webchat.hideToolCalls: true`)
2. **UI toggle** in webchat settings
3. **Collapsed by default** with expand button (current "View" button behavior but collapsed)

## Use case

Users who prefer a clean chat interface without seeing internal tool operations. The current "View" expandable sections help, but the output still clutters the conversation flow.

## Environment

- OpenClaw v2026.1.29
- macOS, Safari/Chrome webchat
