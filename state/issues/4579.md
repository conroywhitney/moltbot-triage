## Description

Problem

When using google-antigravity provider with OAuth profiles, the cooldown mechanism is applied at the profile level, not the model level.

This causes a problem: when Claude (Opus 4.5) hits its daily quota limit or times out, the entire OAuth profile goes into cooldown. As a result, Gemini models on the same profile also become unavailable, even though they have separate quotas on Google's side.

Example

Config:

"fallbacks": [
  "codesome/claude-opus-4-5-20251101",
  "google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash",
  "google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-high"
]

Log when Claude hits quota:

google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking: LLM request timed out. (unknown)
google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash: No available auth profile for google-antigravity (all in cooldown or unavailable). (rate_limit)
google-antigravity/gemini-3-pro-high: No available auth profile for google-antigravity (all in cooldown or unavailable). (rate_limit)

Expected Behavior

Cooldown should be tracked per (profile, model) or per (profile, model-family), so that:

• Claude quota exhaustion → only Claude models on that profile enter cooldown
• Gemini models remain available on the same profile
Workaround

Use google/gemini-3-... (API key auth) instead of google-antigravity/gemini-3-... for fallbacks, since API key auth is independent of OAuth profile cooldowns.
