## Description

**Problem**
Currently, adding and managing model providers requires manual JSON editing. Users must understand the JSON configuration structure, know which fields are required vs optional, manually validate their changes, and re-run full wizards for simple additions.

This creates a high barrier for users who want to try new model providers (for example, adding MiniMax after starting with OpenAI), compare models from different providers, and understand what models are available versus which ones are active.

**User Experience Gap**
The web dashboard provides a generic JSON form for editing configuration, but it lacks pre-defined model templates (users don’t know what keys or values to enter), a visual catalog (no way to see available providers at a glance), a clear catalog vs roster distinction (registered models vs active or default models), and validation feedback (no confirmation that keys or values are valid).

**Proposed Solution**
Introduce a two-tier model management system that separates registered models from active models.

**Model Catalog (Registered Models)**
The catalog would show known providers and available models. It would include pre-defined cards for popular providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and MiniMax. Each provider card would support API key input with validation, a provider-specific model selector, price or limit configuration, and a “register but don’t activate” option. The intent is to allow models to be configured and stored without enabling them.

**Active Roster (Enabled Models)**
The active roster would show only models that are currently in use. It would allow users to enable or disable registered models, set a primary or default model, and control which model handles specific tasks or agents. The intent is to clearly control which models actually run.

**Conceptual UI Layout**
Model Management screen with Add Provider, Active, and Catalog views.
Example entries: OpenAI with API key set and model gpt-4o marked active; Anthropic available for configuration; MiniMax registered with model MiniMax-M2.1 but inactive and ready to enable.

**Benefits**
This would lower the barrier to entry by removing the need to edit JSON, reduce configuration errors through validation, improve discoverability of available providers and models, allow safer experimentation with new providers, and speed up iteration and comparison across models. This directly improves onboarding and supports the core value proposition of easily trying different models.
