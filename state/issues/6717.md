## Description

## Problem

Currently, switching between models requires either:
- CLI commands (`openclaw models set`)
- The `/model` slash command
- Editing config

There's no way to say "use local for this" or "switch to the cheap model" in natural conversation and have the agent actually switch.

## Use Case

Users with both a paid API model (e.g., Claude Opus) and a local model (e.g., Ollama) want to:
- Use the expensive model for complex tasks
- Switch to local/cheap model for simple queries to save money
- Do this fluidly in conversation without leaving the chat

## Proposed Solution

Allow the agent to recognize model-switching intents and either:
1. **Self-invoke** a model switch (if given that capability)
2. **Expose a tool** the agent can call to switch models mid-session
3. **Honor inline directives** like `[model:ollama/gpt-oss:20b]` in user messages

Ideally this would be per-message or per-turn granularity, not just session-wide.

## Current Workaround

The `session_status` tool has an optional `model` parameter for per-session override, but:
- The agent can't invoke it based on user intent ("use local for this")
- It's session-wide, not per-message
- Fallbacks only trigger on failure, not user choice

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.1.30
- Primary: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
- Local: ollama/gpt-oss:20b
