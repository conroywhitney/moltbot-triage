## Description

## Summary
Add a progress bar when Install OpenClaw

## Proposed solution
```
  🦞 OpenClaw Installer
  I'm not magic—I'm just extremely persistent with retries and coping strategies.

✓ Detected: linux
→ Existing OpenClaw installation detected
✓ Node.js v22.22.0 found
✓ Git already installed
→ Installing OpenClaw 2026.1.29...
```
the last step is a long-time part for me, a progress bar would be much better when i'm waiting
