## Description

## Feature Request

**Use Case:**
Users want to optimize token usage by using different models for different types of tasks automatically:
- Complex analysis (crypto DD, research) → Opus
- Simple tasks (reminders, quick questions) → Sonnet/Haiku

**Proposed Solution:**
Add config option for task→model mapping, e.g.:

```json
{
  "modelRouting": {
    "rules": [
      { "keywords": ["remind", "timer", "alarm"], "model": "sonnet" },
      { "keywords": ["analyze", "research", "DD"], "model": "opus" }
    ],
    "default": "sonnet"
  }
}
```

Or let the agent decide with a lightweight pre-classifier.

**Benefit:**
- Reduces cost/quota usage
- Keeps power available for complex tasks
- Better UX without manual /model switching

Submitted via agent on behalf of user.

👍 +1 for this feature! Would love to see task-based routing - currently using per-agent model overrides as a workaround but automatic routing would be much better for cost optimization.
