## Description

## Summary
Pasting an image into the webchat UI causes a sequence gap error and the message fails to send.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open webchat interface (localhost)
2. Have a conversation going (seems to happen after some messages)
3. Paste an image (Cmd+V) into the chat input
4. Try to send

## Expected behavior
Image should upload and send as part of the message, visible to the agent.

## Actual behavior
Error appears: `event gap detected (expected seq 261, got 262); refresh recommended`

The image never sends. Refreshing the page restores chat functionality but the same error occurs when trying to paste another image.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.3.0, arm64)
- Install method: npm (global install via nvm/node v24.13.0)
- Browser: Arc (Chromium-based)

## Logs or screenshots
No relevant errors in `~/.clawdbot/logs/gateway.log` — the error appears client-side only in the webchat UI.
