## Description

## Summary
The user is asking how to optimize the phenomenon occurring with dropIfSlow = true, which is causing extremely severe token consumption. This is a typical "repetition explosion" issue jointly caused by streaming output, slow downstream consumption/packet loss, and full context reconstitution.
## Proposed solution
Provide a set of optimization plans to address the problems of excessive token consumption and repetition explosion caused by slow downstream consumption, full context reconstitution, and the occurrence of the dropIfSlow = true phenomenon in streaming output scenarios.
## Alternatives considered
The user has not mentioned any specific alternative approaches.
## Additional context
The core issue is described as a typical "streaming output + slow downstream consumption/packet loss + full context reconstitution" problem, which ultimately leads to a surge in repetitive content and high token usage.
