## Description

## Problem

When a thread is created from a channel that is bound to a specific agent, the thread does not inherit that binding. Users have to manually add each thread ID to the bindings, which is tedious and not scalable.

## Current Behavior

- Channel `1465518759870730302` is bound to agent `metabo`
- Thread created from that channel gets ID `1466105113822105871`
- Mention patterns like `@metabo` or `@m` don't work in the thread because there's no binding
- Must manually add thread ID to bindings

## Desired Behavior

Option 1: **Automatic parent inheritance**
- Threads automatically inherit the binding of their parent channel

Option 2: **parentId matching in bindings**
```json
{
  "agentId": "metabo",
  "match": {
    "channel": "discord",
    "peer": {
      "kind": "channel",
      "parentId": "1465518759870730302"
    }
  }
}
```

Option 3: **inheritThreads flag**
```json
{
  "agentId": "metabo",
  "match": {
    "channel": "discord",
    "peer": {
      "kind": "channel",
      "id": "1465518759870730302"
    }
  },
  "inheritThreads": true
}
```

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Discord channel with multiple agents using bindings
