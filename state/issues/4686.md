## Description

 Bug Description

  WhatsApp device linking worked successfully on first setup, but after attempting to switch
   to a different number, I can no longer link ANY number. The QR code scans successfully,
  gets stuck at "logging in" phase, and never completes.

  Timeline

  1. Initially: Successfully linked my primary WhatsApp number (+44...) - everything worked
  2. Problem: Bot was sending automatic replies to my wife from my personal number, which was confusing
  3. Attempted fix: Tried switching to my spare number (+90...) to have a dedicated bot number
  4. Result: Linking to spare number failed repeatedly
  5. Now: Cannot link back to original number OR any other number - all attempts fail the same way

  What Happens

  1. Run clawdbot channels login or use dashboard QR
  2. Scan QR code with phone (within 20 seconds)
  3. Phone acknowledges scan, shows "logging in..."
  4. Connection never completes - stays stuck until timeout
  5. Dashboard shows: Linked: Yes, Running: No, Connected: No, Error: "logged out"

  What I've Tried

  - Original number (regular WhatsApp) - FAILS
  - Spare Turkish number (WhatsApp Business) - FAILS
  - Third UK number (regular WhatsApp) - FAILS
  - Cleared all credentials: rm -rf ~/.clawdbot/credentials/whatsapp
  - Removed and re-added WhatsApp channel completely
  - Reinstalled clawdbot: npm uninstall -g clawdbot && npm install -g clawdbot
  - Ran clawdbot doctor --fix
  - Restarted gateway multiple times
  - Waited 24+ hours for any rate limiting to expire
  - Different networks (WiFi and mobile data)
  - Contacted WhatsApp support - they confirmed no account restrictions

  Critical Finding

  web.whatsapp.com works perfectly using "Link with phone number" (pairing code method). I
  can link my phone to web.whatsapp.com without any issues. This proves:
  - My WhatsApp accounts are NOT blocked
  - My phone/network is NOT the problem
  - The issue is specific to clawdbot/Baileys QR linking

  Environment

  - Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
  - OS: Windows 10/11
  - Node version: 24.x
  - Phone: iPhone (latest iOS)
  - WhatsApp: Latest version from App Store

  Feature Request

  Would it be possible to add support for the pairing code method (link with phone number) as an alternative to QR codes? Since this method works on web.whatsapp.com, it might bypass whatever is causing the QR linking to fail.
