## Description

## Feature Proposal: `instructions` field for agent config

### Problem
Currently `systemPrompt` completely replaces SOUL.md when set on an agent. This creates a maintenance burden:
- Changes to SOUL.md must be manually mirrored to all agents with overrides
- No way to make agent-specific adjustments without duplicating persona

### Proposed Solution
Add a new optional field `instructions: string | null` to agent config that **appends** to SOUL.md instead of replacing it.

```json5
{
  id: "glm",
  instructions: "Use emojis frequently! ✨"
}
```

**Behavior:**
- If `instructions` is set: Use SOUL.md + "\n\n" + instructions
- If `systemPrompt` is set: Use systemPrompt (existing behavior, takes precedence)
- If neither: Use SOUL.md (default behavior)

### Use Cases
1. **GLM agent:** Keep Cami persona (SOUL.md) + add "more emojis" instruction
2. **Tone adjustments:** Make one agent more concise without copying SOUL.md
3. **Temporary instructions:** "Reply very briefly" for specific use case

### Alternatives Considered
1. `systemPromptAppend` - longer name
2. `promptSuffix` - implies it always goes at end
3. `extraInstructions` - more verbose
4. Keep using `systemPrompt` - requires full SOUL.md duplication

I chose `instructions` as it's short and matches common config patterns.

### Impact
- Config schema: Add optional `instructions` field
- Agent loop: Check `instructions` and append if present
- Docs: Document in concepts/agent.md
- No breaking changes (backward compatible)

### Questions for Maintainers
1. Is there a better name than `instructions`?
2. Should existing `systemPrompt` behavior be kept or deprecated?
3. Any edge cases I should consider for the append behavior?

Thanks for considering! 🦎
