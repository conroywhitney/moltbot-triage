## Description

## Summary

What went wrong?
Cron jobs are created successfully but never execute. The scheduler shows enabled: true but nextWakeAtMs: null for all job types.


## Steps to reproduce

Configure heartbeat in openclaw.json:
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "heartbeat": { "every": "15m" }
    }
  },
  "cron": { "enabled": true }
}
Create a cron job:
openclaw cron add --name "Test" --every 60000 --text "Test job"
Check status:
openclaw cron status --json
Expected: nextWakeAtMs should have a timestamp
Actual: nextWakeAtMs: null

## Expected behavior

What did you expect to happen?

## Actual behavior

Observations
[heartbeat] started appears in logs on gateway startup
No heartbeat tick events ever logged (no [heartbeat] tick or similar)
All jobs have empty state: {}
openclaw system heartbeat last --json returns null
Tested with all schedule types: at, every, cron
Tested with both wakeMode: "next-heartbeat" and wakeMode: "now"
Manual wake events (openclaw system event --mode now) are accepted but don't trigger job evaluation
Gateway restarts don't fix the issue
Updating from 2026.1.30 to 2026.2.1 didn't fix it
Relevant logs
2026-02-03T00:36:36.147Z [heartbeat] started
No subsequent heartbeat activity logged over 15+ hours.

Config
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "heartbeat": { "every": "15m" }
    }
  },
  "cron": { "enabled": true }
}

## Environment

OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1 (also reproduced on 2026.1.30)
OS: macOS 26.2 (arm64)
Node: v22.15.0
Install method: npm global
