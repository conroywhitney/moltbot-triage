## Description

## Summary
openclaw doctor shows inconsistent state: user selects "Yes" to cleanup, but output says "skipped" and cleanup hints reference wrong service names.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Run `openclaw doctor`
2. Select `Yes` when prompted to remove legacy gateway services (clawdbot/moltbot)
3. Observe the output

## Expected behavior
When `Yes` is selected, the legacy services should be cleaned up, and the output should reflect that action was taken. Cleanup hints should reference the correct service names (clawdbot-gateway.service or moltbot-gateway.service).

## Actual behavior
After selecting `Yes`, the output shows `Legacy gateway cleanup skipped`, but then displays cleanup hints that reference `openclaw-gateway.service` instead of `clawdbot-gateway.service` or `moltbot-gateway.service`.

```
◇ Remove legacy gateway services (clawdbot/moltbot) now? │ Yes │ ◇ Legacy gateway cleanup skipped ─────╮
```

The cleanup hints shown are:
```
- systemctl --user disable --now openclaw-gateway.service
- rm ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
```

## Environment
