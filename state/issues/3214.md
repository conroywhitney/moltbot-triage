## Description

## Problem

Currently `thinkingDefault` is only available in `agents.defaults`, applying globally to all agents. When running multiple agents (e.g. main, dev, vanilla) with different roles, there's no way to assign different thinking levels per agent.

## Proposed Solution

Allow `thinkingDefault` (and ideally `verboseDefault`, `blockStreamingDefault`) as optional fields in `agents.list[*]` entries, overriding the global default:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "thinkingDefault": "medium"
    },
    "list": [
      { "id": "main", "name": "Molt" },
      { "id": "dev", "name": "Dev", "thinkingDefault": "high" },
      { "id": "vanilla", "name": "Vanilla", "thinkingDefault": "medium" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Use Case

- A **dev agent** benefits from deeper reasoning (`high`) for coding/debugging tasks
- A **general assistant** works fine with `medium`
- A **lightweight agent** could use `low` or `minimal` to save costs

## Current Workaround

None clean — the only option is manually toggling `/reasoning` per session after creation, which doesn't persist across session resets.

## Schema Impact

Add `thinkingDefault`, `verboseDefault`, and `blockStreamingDefault` as optional fields to the `agents.list[*]` item schema (same types as in `agents.defaults`). Agent-level values override the global default; if absent, fall back to `agents.defaults`.
