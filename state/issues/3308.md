## Description

**BUG REPORT: Critical Privacy Issue - Messages Appearing in Wrong User's Chat**

**Severity**: CRITICAL - This is a serious privacy/security vulnerability

**Description**:
Multiple users interacting with the same Telegram bot instance are seeing each other's messages and bot responses in their respective chats. This represents a critical failure of user session isolation that compromises user privacy.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Configure Clawdbot with Telegram integration for multiple users
2. Add multiple user IDs to the allowFrom list in the Telegram channel configuration
3. Have multiple users interact with the bot simultaneously
4. Observe that messages from one user appear in another user's chat

**Expected Behavior**:
- Each user should have their own private session with the bot
- Messages sent by User A should only appear in User A's chat
- Messages sent by User B should only appear in User B's chat
- Bot responses should only go to the respective user's chat

**Actual Behavior**:
- Messages from one user are appearing in other users' chats
- Bot responses intended for one user sometimes appear in another user's chat
- Complete breakdown of session isolation

**Environment**:
- Clawdbot Version: 2026.1.24-3
- Platform: Windows
- Channel: Telegram

**Configuration**:
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "botToken": "xxxxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyyyyyyy-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz",
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "streamMode": "partial",
      "allowFrom": [xxxxxxxx, yyyyyyyy]
    }
  }
}

**Impact**:
This is a serious privacy breach that exposes one user's conversations to other users. This could lead to sensitive information being inadvertently shared between users.

**Additional Information**:
- Each user has their own numeric chat ID
- Users initiate contact with the bot separately
- The issue appears to affect both incoming messages and bot responses
- This makes the multi-user setup unusable for any scenario requiring privacy

Please treat this as a high-priority security issue requiring immediate attention.
