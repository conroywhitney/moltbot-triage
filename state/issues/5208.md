## Description

OpenAI auth login succeeds but auth-profiles.json is not created, causing auth: missing for openai-codex models
What went wrong?

I logged in using OpenAI auth (Codex flow) successfully, and also completed openclaw onboard including model selection.
However, no auth-profiles.json is created, and OpenClaw/Clawdbot fails to associate the OpenAI credentials with the selected models.

As a result, running /models status shows:

```
[openai-codex]
endpoint: default
auth: missing

```

This makes it impossible to use GPT-5.2, even though onboarding and auth appeared to complete successfully.

Steps to reproduce

Run OpenAI auth login (Codex / browser-based flow)

Complete the login successfully in the browser

Run:

openclaw onboard


Select OpenAI / openai-codex models (e.g. GPT-5.2) during onboarding

After onboarding completes, run:

/models status

Expected behavior

After OpenAI auth login, an auth-profiles.json (or equivalent auth profile) should be created

openai-codex models should show a valid auth profile

/models status should NOT report auth: missing

GPT-5.2 should be usable immediately after onboarding

Actual behavior

OpenAI auth login succeeds

openclaw onboard completes, including model selection

No auth-profiles.json is created

/models status reports:

```
[openai-codex]
endpoint: default
auth: missing

```

GPT-5.2 cannot be used due to missing auth

Environment

Clawdbot / OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29

OS: Windows 11 x64

Node.js version: 24.13

Install method: npm (global)

Auth method: OpenAI auth (Codex / browser login)

Gateway mode: local
