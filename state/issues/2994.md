## Description

## Severity: High

## Description
SHA1 is used for hashing operations. SHA1 is cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks.

## Location
- `src/agents/sandbox/shared.ts` (line 10)
- `src/agents/sandbox/config-hash.ts` (line 52)

```typescript
crypto.createHash("sha1").update(trimmed).digest("hex")
```

## Risk
SHA1 collisions can be exploited to bypass integrity checks.

## Recommendation
- Replace SHA1 with SHA-256 or SHA-512
- Audit all cryptographic operations for weak algorithms
