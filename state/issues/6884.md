## Description

## Description
The gateway crashes after successfully sending a cross-user message via the `message` tool. The message is delivered, but the gateway restarts immediately after.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. User A asks the bot to send a message to User B (different Telegram chat)
2. Bot calls `message` tool with `action=send`, `target=<user_b_id>`, `message=...`
3. Message is delivered to User B
4. Gateway crashes/restarts

## Expected Behavior
Gateway should remain stable after sending cross-user messages.

## Actual Behavior
Gateway restarts ~2 minutes after the message tool completes. The message is successfully delivered before the crash.

## Logs
```
04:42:25 - embedded run tool start: tool=message
04:42:25 - Tracking pending messaging text: tool=message len=102
04:44:40 - [gateway] listening on ws://127.0.0.1:18789 (restart)
```

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Platform: Raspberry Pi (arm, Linux 6.1.21-v7+)
- Node: v22.15.0
- Channel: Telegram

## Additional Context
- Happens consistently when using message tool to send to a different user/chat
- Regular replies to the same chat work fine
- The synthetic error appears in transcript after restart
