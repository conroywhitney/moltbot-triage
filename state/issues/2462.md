## Description

## Description
Automatic ack reactions (configured via `messages.ackReaction`) are not being applied to inbound Slack messages, even though manual reactions via the `message` tool work correctly.

## Config
```json
"messages": {
  "ackReaction": "🧠",
  "ackReactionScope": "all",
  "removeAckAfterReply": false
}
```

## Slack Scopes
Bot has `reactions:write` and `reactions:read` scopes.

## Observed Behavior
- Inbound DM messages do not receive the 🧠 ack reaction automatically
- Manual reactions via the `message` tool (action: react) work correctly
- No errors in logs related to ack reactions - they simply don't appear to fire
- Gateway restart did not resolve the issue

## Expected Behavior
Per the docs, with `ackReactionScope: "all"`, every inbound message should receive the configured ack reaction.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Slack (socket mode)
- OS: macOS 26.2 (arm64)
- Node: v24.11.0

## Comments

Possibly related to #2003 — same code path in `dispatch.js` handles ack reactions. That issue reports acks are added but not removed; this issue reports acks not added at all. Both involve block streaming enabled. May be DM-specific or a different manifestation of the same underlying issue.

### @luc-anise (2026-01-27)

**Update:** Tested with `blockStreamingDefault: off` — ack reactions still don't fire. So this is a separate issue from #2003, not related to block streaming.

The ack reaction simply never gets added to inbound Slack DM messages, regardless of block streaming setting.

### @rossshannon (2026-01-30)

Slack uses a shortcode format for emojis. So whereas Telegram will accept the Unicode emoji “👀” as the ack response, Slack requires the string `:eyes:`.

Works in Telegram:
```
  "messages": {
    "ackReaction": "👀",
    "ackReactionScope": "all"
  }
```

Works in Slack
```
  "messages": {
    "ackReaction": ":eyes:",
    "ackReactionScope": "all"
  }
```
