## Description

## Description

Cron jobs with \kind: systemEvent\ fire correctly, but the agent does not process them or act on them until a user sends a message.

## Tested Configurations

1. \wakeMode: next-heartbeat\ with heartbeat enabled (every 5m) - **FAILS**
2. \wakeMode: now\ - **FAILS**

## Expected Behavior

Agent should wake up and process system events when cron fires, even without user interaction.

## Actual Behavior

- Crons fire successfully (verified in logs)
- System messages queue up
- Agent only processes them when user sends a message
- Even with explicit instructions like 'USE MESSAGE TOOL', agent doesn't act until prompted

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Node.js: v25.4.0
- OS: Windows 11
- Channel: Telegram
- Model: claude-opus-4-5 (Anthropic)
- Heartbeat: enabled (5m interval)

## Workaround

Using \sessions_spawn\ to create sub-agents works. Standalone scripts bypassing Clawdbot also work. But direct cron → agent → message tool fails.

## Logs

Doctor output shows heartbeat is configured:
\\\
Heartbeat interval: 5m (main)
\\\

But agent doesn't wake for cron events.
