## Description

## Summary

Model switching from Claude Opus 4.5 to Claude Sonnet 4 caused a system crash on OpenClaw 2026.1.30.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Running OpenClaw 2026.1.30 with Claude Opus 4.5 configured
2. Attempt to switch model to Claude Sonnet 4
3. System crashes and becomes unresponsive

## Expected behavior

Model switching should either work cleanly or fail gracefully with a clear error message.

## Actual behavior

- System crashed and became unresponsive
- After the crash, auth profiles weren't properly configured
- Fix required running openclaw onboard → "Update values" to properly configure auth

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
