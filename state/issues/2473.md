## Description

## Summary
Native WhatsApp @mentions (the blue highlighted mentions that appear when you tap @ and select a participant) are not being detected for mention gating purposes. Only text-based mention patterns work.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Enable `requireMention: true` for WhatsApp groups
2. Configure mention patterns: `mentionPatterns: ["hivemind", "HiveMind"]`
3. In a WhatsApp group, send a message using the native @mention (tap @, select bot from participant list)
4. Send another message with just the text "hivemind"

## Expected Behavior
Both messages should trigger mention gating and reach the agent.

## Actual Behavior
- Native @mention message: **NOT received** by agent (no inbound log entry)
- Text pattern message: **Received** successfully

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- WhatsApp Business account (name has space: "Hive Mind")
- `groupPolicy: "open"`
- `groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } }`

## Logs
Gateway logs show the text pattern message as an inbound group message, but native @mention messages don't appear at all:
```
[whatsapp] Inbound message 120363426233474636@g.us -> +12272878595 (group, 345 chars)
```

## Workaround
Users can type the bot name as plain text (e.g., "hivemind") instead of using the native @mention.

## Notes
- This may be related to how Baileys handles `mentionedJid` in incoming messages
- WhatsApp Business accounts require a space in the display name, so native mentions show as "@Hive Mind"
