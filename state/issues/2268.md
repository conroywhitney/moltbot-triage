## Description

When using the companion app in remote mode, you get "gateway token missing" error with no indication of where to set the token.

## What happened

- Set up remote mode with SSH tunnel
- App shows "gateway token missing"
- Tried setting `gateway.auth.token` on Mac - didnt work

## Root cause

For remote mode, the app reads from `gateway.remote.token`, not `gateway.auth.token`.

Found in `GatewayEndpointStore.swift` line ~189.

## Solution

Set matching tokens:
- Server: `gateway.auth.token` 
- Mac (remote mode): `gateway.remote.token`

## Suggestion

Either:
1. Improve error message to say "set gateway.remote.token in ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json"
2. Or fall back to `gateway.auth.token` when `gateway.remote.token` is missing
