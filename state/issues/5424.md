## Description

## Summary

- When using the Antigravity Gemini provider, agent prompts remain idle with 0 token usage and produce no response, even though onboarding completes successfully.
- OpenClaw reports that Antigravity is “outdated”. The Antigravity desktop application reports itself as up to date when checking for updates, but the installed version is 1.104.0, while a newer version (1.15.8) exists and appears not yet rolled out to all users. This makes it unclear whether the warning is expected or related to the issue.
- During the OAuth login flow, the redirect URL opens a blank page. Although pasting the URL into the terminal allows the flow to continue, it is unclear whether the blank redirect is expected behavior or related to the agent remaining idle.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install OpenClaw via pnpm
2. Install Antigravity using the official website .exe
3. Configure OpenClaw to use the google-antigravity / gemini provider
4. Complete the OAuth login flow
5. The redirect URL opens a blank page
6. Paste the redirect URL into the terminal when prompted
7. Start OpenClaw TUI
8. Run an agent prompt (e.g. /agent hello)

## Expected behavior

- Agent prompt should invoke the Gemini model
- Token usage should increase
- A response should be returned to the user

## Actual behavior

- Agent session starts successfully but remains idle
- Token usage stays at 0
- No response is returned
- OpenClaw reports that Antigravity is “outdated”
- No explicit error message is shown

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.29
- OS: Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- Install method: pnpm 
- Antigravity version (from CLI): 1.104.0 (x64)
