## Description

## Summary

The macOS app's Talk mode TTS does not respect the user's preferred system voice. It uses `AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language:)` which returns any voice for the language, ignoring the voice configured in **System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → System Voice**.

## Current Behavior

In `TalkSystemSpeechSynthesizer.swift`:
```swift
if let language, let voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: language) {
    utterance.voice = voice
}
```

This selects a voice based on language code only, not the user's preference. Users who set a Siri voice or other preferred voice in System Settings find the app still uses a different default voice.

## Expected Behavior

The app should either:
1. Use the system's default voice (respecting user preference), or
2. Provide an in-app setting to select from available `AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices()`

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open **System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content**
2. Set **System Voice** to a Siri voice (e.g., "Siri Voice 1")
3. Open OpenClaw.app and enable Talk mode
4. Trigger a spoken response
5. Observe: The app uses a different voice than the one configured

## Suggested Fix

Option A - Respect system preference:
```swift
// Use nil voice to let system pick the preferred default
utterance.voice = nil
```

Option B - Add voice selection setting:
- Add `openclaw.talkVoiceIdentifier` preference
- Expose a voice picker in **Settings → Voice**
- Use `AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(identifier:)` with the stored preference

## Environment

- OpenClaw.app 2026.1.29
- macOS Sequoia
- Source: `apps/shared/OpenClawKit/Sources/OpenClawKit/TalkSystemSpeechSynthesizer.swift`
