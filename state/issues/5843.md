## Description

## Bug Description

Discord threads stop receiving new messages after the agent responds with NO_REPLY (or possibly after any response that closes a tool-use cycle).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have agent respond to messages in a Discord thread
2. Agent receives a system/background message and responds with NO_REPLY
3. User sends additional messages in the thread
4. Messages are visible in Discord but never trigger the agent session

## Expected Behavior

Thread should continue to be polled for new messages regardless of response type.

## Actual Behavior

Thread goes "deaf" — messages accumulate in Discord but are not routed to the agent session. The only workaround is:
- User pings the agent in a different channel
- Agent manually sends a message to the thread (which seems to re-activate polling)

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Channel: Discord
- Thread type: Public thread in guild channel

## Additional Context

This happened multiple times in the same session. After each manual intervention (agent sending a message to the thread), polling resumed briefly but then stopped again after the next response cycle.

The issue may be related to how thread subscriptions are managed after a turn completes — possibly the poller is unsubscribing when it should remain active.
