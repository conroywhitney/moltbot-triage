## Description

## Bug Report

After updating OpenClaw to version 2026.1.30, from a setup on the version 2026.1.29 all plugins fail to install with the same error:

```
Error: package.json missing openclaw.extensions
```

## Affected Plugins
- discord-0.8.2
- teams (latest)
- mattermost (latest)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Update to OpenClaw 2026.1.30
2. Run: `openclaw plugins install discord`
3. Error: package.json missing openclaw.extensions

## Expected
Plugins should install and work with the latest OpenClaw version.

## Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.1.30
- OS: Windows 11 + WSL2

## Impact
All plugin-based integrations are blocked. Users cannot use Discord, Teams, Mattermost, WhatsApp with this version.

@estacado did you find a workaround, like adding that empty section or something?
