## Description

## Bug Description

The `OPENAI_TTS_VOICES` allowlist in `tts/tts.js` is missing the newer OpenAI TTS voices:
- `cedar`
- `ballad`
- `juniper`
- `verse`

When a user configures one of these voices in their config (e.g., `messages.tts.openai.voice: "cedar"`), the `isValidOpenAIVoice()` check fails, causing TTS to silently fall back to Edge TTS instead of using the configured OpenAI voice.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Set `messages.tts.openai.voice` to `cedar` in config
2. Use the `tts` tool
3. Audio plays with Edge TTS (female Microsoft voice) instead of OpenAI cedar (male voice)

## Expected Behavior

The configured OpenAI voice should be used.

## Suggested Fix

Add the missing voices to `OPENAI_TTS_VOICES` in `src/tts/tts.ts`:

```typescript
export const OPENAI_TTS_VOICES = [
    "alloy",
    "ash",
    "ballad",  // new
    "cedar",   // new
    "coral",
    "echo",
    "fable",
    "juniper", // new
    "onyx",
    "nova",
    "sage",
    "shimmer",
    "verse",   // new
];
```
