## Description

## Environment
- **Clawdbot:** 2026.1.23-1
- **macOS:** 26.3 (Build 25D5101c)
- **Terminals tested:** Ghostty, Warp
- **Shell:** zsh

## Summary
TUI output fails to render when session is created with a mixed-case name. Switching to an all-lowercase session name resolves the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch TUI with mixed-case session name:
   ```
   clawdbot tui -session ChiefOfStaff
   ```
2. Send messages to the session
3. Observe: output does not render in the TUI

## Expected Behavior
Output renders normally regardless of session name casing.

## Actual Behavior
No output rendered. TUI appears unresponsive to messages.

## Workaround
Use all-lowercase session name:
```
clawdbot tui -session chiefofstaff
```

## Notes
- Reproduced across multiple terminal emulators (Warp, Ghostty), suggesting the issue is in Clawdbot's session handling, not terminal-specific.
- Possible case-sensitivity mismatch in session name lookup or WebSocket routing.
