## Description

## Problem

When running commands on remote nodes (via `nodes.run`), there's a delay between command execution and completion. The results are later injected as system messages into the chat session, which creates noise — especially when the agent has already processed and responded to the results by the time the async completion arrives.

Example of the noisy messages:
```
System: [2026-01-29 11:33:00 EST] Exec finished (node=..., code 0)
... (truncated output)

An async command you ran earlier has completed...
```

## Proposed Solution

Add a configuration option to control how async exec completions are handled:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "asyncResults": "inject" | "silent" | "notify"
  }
}
```

- **inject** (current behavior): Inject full results as system messages
- **silent**: Log results but don't surface in chat
- **notify**: Brief notification only (e.g., "Exec finished on node X") without full output

Alternatively, this could be a webchat UI setting to hide/collapse system messages, or an agent-level config.

## Use Case

When using MacWhisper transcripts or other large outputs from remote nodes, the delayed async messages clutter the conversation after the agent has already processed and summarized the content.
