## Description

## Feature Request: Add PDF Support to Read Tool

### Description
The current `read` tool supports text files and images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP), but does not support PDF files. This limits the ability to read common document formats like resumes, papers, and reports that are often shared in PDF format.

### Use Case
- Reading PDF resumes during job applications
- Reading PDF documentation and papers
- Processing PDF reports and forms

### Proposed Solution
Add PDF parsing capability to the `read` tool, similar to how image support works.

**Technical approach:**
- Use a PDF parsing library like `pdf-parse` or `pdf-lib`
- Detect `.pdf` file extensions and route to PDF parser
- Return extracted text in the same format as other text files

### Implementation Location
Based on code analysis, the read tool is located in:
- `dist/agents/pi-tools.read.js` - Main read tool wrapper
- Uses `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` for core functionality

### Additional Notes
This is a common feature in AI assistants and would improve usability significantly. Python-based AI agents (like Claude Code) already support PDF reading out of the box.

**Would appreciate feedback from maintainers:**
1. Is this a feature you're interested in accepting?
2. Any preferred PDF libraries (considering bundle size and dependencies)?
3. Should this be a core feature or a skill/plugin?

Thanks! 🦞
