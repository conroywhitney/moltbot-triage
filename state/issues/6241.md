## Description

## Description

When running `exec` tool calls, the gateway appears to be sending process status messages (e.g., "terminated") as Discord replies to the original user message.

## Reproduction

1. User sends a message in Discord asking to run a task
2. Agent uses `exec` tool to run a shell command
3. When the command completes, Discord receives a reply containing just "terminated"

## Evidence

- **Channel:** Discord thread
- **Time:** 2026-02-01 12:50:40 UTC
- **Message ID:** 1467502413169688597
- **Content:** `terminated`
- **Context:** This was sent as a reply to the user's original request, ~2 seconds after an exec command completed

The agent (Claude) did not send this message via the `message` tool — it appears to be automatic gateway behavior.

## Expected Behavior

Exec process states should not be surfaced as user-facing Discord messages. These are internal tool mechanics.

## Impact

- Confusing UX for users
- Makes the bot appear to be malfunctioning
- Could leak internal process details

## Environment

- Clawdbot running on EC2 Amazon Linux
- Discord channel
- exec tool with shell commands
