## Description

## Problem
Streaming/block-flush replies can include 1-2 blank lines before the actual response text when extended thinking is enabled.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Use an Anthropic model with extended thinking enabled.
2. Send a message over a channel that uses the streaming/block-flush path (for example, iMessage).
3. Observe the assistant reply.

## Expected behavior
Replies should start with the intended text with no leading blank lines.

## Actual behavior
Replies sometimes begin with one or more blank lines before the content.
