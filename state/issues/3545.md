## Description

The `~/.clawdbot/credentials/` folder name is misleading.

**What it sounds like:** Storage for secrets/credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.)

**What it actually contains:** Items line runtime state files, eg:
- `telegram-allowFrom.json` — allowlist of chat IDs
- `*-pairing.json` — pending pairing request state

These are runtime state files, not credentials. The actual secrets live in `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`.

**Suggestion:** Rename to something like `state/` or `runtime/` to better reflect its purpose, or move actual channel auth into it to match the name.
