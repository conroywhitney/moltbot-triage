## Description

## Summary
When monitoring WhatsApp groups in passive observation mode, the inbound message logs capture `from` (group JID), `body`, and `timestamp`, but do NOT include the individual sender/participant within the group.

## Current Behavior
Log output:
```json
{"from":"groupid@g.us", "to":"+1234567890", "body":"message text", "timestamp":1234567890}
```

## Requested Behavior
Include `pushName` and/or `participantJid` in the log output:
```json
{"from":"groupid@g.us", "to":"+1234567890", "body":"message text", "timestamp":1234567890, "pushName":"Sender Name", "participant":"sender@s.whatsapp.net"}
```

## Why This Matters
For passive group monitoring (e.g., summarizing group activity, tracking who said what), we need to know which group member sent each message. The data is already captured (`pushName`, `senderJid`, `participantJid`) - it's just not included in the log output.

## Code Reference
In `dist/web/inbound/monitor.js`, the log line is:
```javascript
inboundLogger.info({ from, to: selfE164 ?? "me", body, mediaPath, mediaType, timestamp }, "inbound message");
```

The `inboundMessage` object already includes `pushName: senderName` — this just needs to be added to the log call.
