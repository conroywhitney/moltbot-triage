## Description

## Summary

During the onboarding wizard (`openclaw onboard`), users cannot navigate back to a previous step if they make a mistake or want to change an earlier selection. The only options are to continue forward or cancel and restart the entire process.

This is frustrating when:
- You accidentally skip a step or select the wrong option
- You realize mid-wizard that an earlier choice was wrong
- You want to review what you entered in a previous step

## Proposed solution

Add a "Back" option to each onboarding step that allows users to return to the previous step with their prior selections preserved.

Suggested UX:
- Show `[b] Back` alongside existing options at each step
- Preserve user input when navigating backwards
- Allow forward navigation to restore previously-entered values

## Alternatives considered

1. **Cancel and restart** — Current behavior; loses all progress
2. **Resume from last step (#5880)** — Addresses interrupted sessions but not in-session navigation
3. **Post-wizard edit command** — e.g., `openclaw config edit` to fix values after completion; doesn't help during initial setup

## Additional context

Related PR: #5880 (resume interrupted installation) addresses a similar but distinct problem.

The onboarding wizard uses `@clack/prompts` which may have built-in support for back navigation or require custom handling.
