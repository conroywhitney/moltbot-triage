## Description

## Summary

When `replyToMode` is set to `"all"` (or any value that causes replies to go to threads), and a user replies within a thread, the new thread session is created without any context of the existing thread messages. This breaks conversation continuity.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Configure Slack channel with `replyToMode: "all"`
2. Mention the bot in a channel
3. Bot replies in a thread
4. User replies to that thread
5. Bot creates a new thread session with no knowledge of step 2-3

## Expected behavior

When a thread session is created, it should include the existing thread messages as conversation context, preserving continuity.

## Actual behavior

The thread session starts fresh with no context of previous messages in the thread, even though those messages are part of the same conversation.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Linux (Raspberry Pi OS)
- Install method: npm global

## Additional context

**Config:**
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "replyToMode": "all",
      "thread": { "inheritParent": false }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: `thread.inheritParent: true` is not a viable workaround as it inherits the entire parent channel history, not just the thread (causing excessive token usage and irrelevant context).
