## Description

## Summary
The message filtering logic for reasoning tags (`
`.
2. Allow the tag to be displayed if it's part of a code block or escaped text.
In any case, it should NEVER discard the remaining part of the message.

## Actual behavior
The gateway filter acts as a "hard cut." Once it detects the sequence `<think`, it seems to fail its regex/parsing and drops the rest of the message payload entirely. This happens regardless of whether the tag is in a code block or plain text.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3 (885167d)
- OS: Linux 6.14.0-37-generic (x64)
- Install method: pnpm
