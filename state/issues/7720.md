## Description

**Feature:** Tool-level command allowlist configuration

**What happened:**
We attempted to implement OWASP security hardening with this config:
```javascript
{
  "tools": {
    "exec": {
      "security": "allowlist",
      "allowlist": ["ls", "cat", "grep", "find", "git", "docker"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```
Invalid config at /home/seraph/.openclaw/openclaw.json:
- tools.exec: Unrecognized key: "allowlist"
```

**Current behavior:**
`tools.exec.security` accepts:
- `"full"` — all commands allowed
- `"deny"` — all commands blocked
- ??? (what other values work?)

There's no way to specify WHICH commands are allowed.

**Requested behavior:**
```javascript
"tools": {
  "exec": {
    "security": "allowlist",  // new mode
    "allowlist": [
      "ls", "cat", "head", "tail", "grep", "find",  // safe read-only
      "git", "docker", "curl", "wget", "jq", "node"  // vetted tools
    ]
  }
}
```

When `security: "allowlist"`:
- Only commands in the `allowlist` array can be executed
- Everything else is blocked
- Attempts to run blocked commands return error without execution

**Why this matters:**
- OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 #A02 (Insecure Tool Invocation)
- Defense in depth: agent can use tools it needs, but can't run `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `iptables`, etc.
- Currently the only options are "allow everything" or "allow nothing"

**Workaround:**
None. We're running with `security: "full"` and relying on external monitoring.

**Use case:**
Production autonomous agents that need file/git/docker access but shouldn't have sudo or destructive commands.

**Related:** Part of our response to Palo Alto Networks' claim that OpenClaw is fundamentally insecure.
