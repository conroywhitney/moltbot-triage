## Description

## Feature Request: Cartesia TTS Support

**What**
Add Cartesia (https://cartesia.ai) as a TTS provider option alongside ElevenLabs, OpenAI, and Edge TTS.

**Why**
Cartesia Sonic offers significantly lower latency (~50-100ms) compared to other providers, making it ideal for real-time voice interactions. Key features:
- Ultra-low latency streaming TTS
- 40+ languages
- Voice cloning capabilities
- Emotional expression and laughter support

**Proposed config**
```json
{
  "messages": {
    "tts": {
      "provider": "cartesia",
      "cartesia": {
        "apiKey": "xxx",
        "voiceId": "xxx",
        "model": "sonic-2024-12-12"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use case**
Users who prioritize speed/latency over other factors would benefit from this integration.
