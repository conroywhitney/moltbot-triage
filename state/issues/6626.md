## Description

# macOS app terminates after completing exec (system.run) commands

## Problem

The macOS app quits about 2 seconds after completing any `system.run` exec command. This happens every time, making the app unusable as a persistent node for exec operations.

The app does not crash and no crash report is generated. It performs a graceful exit. The app runs fine when idle but quits shortly after any exec command completes.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Launch OpenClaw.app in **remote** mode (connected to gateway on another machine)
2. Verify app is running and node shows as connected
3. Send any exec command via the gateway (e.g., `echo hello` or `hostname`)
4. Command completes successfully and returns output
5. App terminates ~2 seconds after exec completion

## Timeline Evidence

```
09:50:19 - App launched
09:51:35 - Exec command sent ("echo hello" on My-Mac)
09:52:06 - Exec completed successfully (output: "hello")
09:52:08 - App terminated (2 seconds after exec finished)
```

Additional runs showed the same pattern. The app runs fine for minutes when idle, but any exec command triggers termination ~2 seconds after completion. Reproduced this on five consecutive test runs.

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The app seems to terminate itself after completing IPC handling for exec requests. Possibly a reference counting bug where completing the exec response triggers app termination, or incorrect lifecycle management specific to remote mode.

## Environment

- **App version**: 2026.1.30 (build 8469)
- **macOS**: 15.6.1 (24G90)
- **Hardware**: Mac Mini (Mac14,12)
- **Connection mode**: Remote (gateway on separate VPS via Tailscale)
- **Node service**: Running via launchd (`ai.openclaw.node`)

## Diagnostic Details

- **No crash report generated** in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`
- **System log shows no errors** and app exits cleanly with no exception
- **Exec approvals config**: `security: "full"` (no approval prompts)
- **Node capabilities**: `browser, system` both show as available

## Workaround

None. The app must be relaunched after every exec command, which defeats the purpose of running it as a persistent node.

## Related

This is separate from the mic-related crashes (#3529, #5099, #5656) which produce crash reports. This issue produces no crash report and affects exec functionality only.
