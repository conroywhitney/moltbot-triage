## Description

## Bug Description

During `openclaw onboard`, the Slack channel allowlist prompt says "comma-separated" but doesn't actually parse the input into separate channel entries.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
2. Configure Slack integration
3. At the prompt `Slack channels allowlist (comma-separated)`, enter: `#channel1 #channel2` or `#channel1, #channel2`
4. Complete the wizard

## Expected Behavior

The config should have separate entries:
```json
"channels": {
  "#channel1": { "allow": true },
  "#channel2": { "allow": true }
}
```

## Actual Behavior

The entire input string is saved as a single key:
```json
"channels": {
  "#channel1 #channel2": { "allow": true }
}
```

This causes channel matching to fail since the bot looks for an exact match on the channel name.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- OS: macOS
- Channel: Slack (Socket Mode)

## Workaround

Manually edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to split the channels into separate entries.
