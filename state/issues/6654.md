## Description

## Summary

[zerobrew](https://github.com/lucasgelfond/zerobrew) seems much faster (5x-20x) than homebrew. Granted it's only used to install skills, but would it be a good update?

## Proposed solution

1) Propose zerobrew installation instead of homebrew during setup. 
2) In skill installations, try to use zerobrew first before reverting to homebrew.
