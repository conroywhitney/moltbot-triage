## Description

## Bug Description

The Control UI displays warnings about Homebrew not being installed, even when the user has explicitly set `skills.install.preferBrew: false` in their config.

## Expected Behavior

When `preferBrew: false` is configured, the UI should either:
1. Not show brew-related warnings at all, OR
2. Show a message indicating the system will use the native package manager (apt/dnf/etc)

## Current Behavior

The UI shows warnings like "Install with brew" for skills that document brew installation methods, regardless of the user's `preferBrew` config setting.

## Impact

This is confusing for users on Linux systems (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) who:
- Have explicitly disabled brew preference
- Are perfectly fine using native package managers (apt, dnf, etc.)
- See persistent warnings about a tool they don't need or want

## Environment

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Clawdbot Version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Config:** `skills.install.preferBrew: false`
- **Package Manager:** apt (system default)

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure `skills.install.preferBrew: false` on a Linux system without brew
2. Open the Control UI
3. Navigate to skills section
4. Observe "brew is not installed" warnings despite the config setting

## Suggested Fix

The UI should respect the `preferBrew` config and adapt messaging accordingly:
- If `preferBrew: false`: Show native package manager info instead
- If `preferBrew: true` but brew missing: Show current warning
- Consider detecting the system package manager and showing appropriate installation commands

## Additional Context

Skills work fine without brew when `preferBrew: false`. The warnings are purely cosmetic but cause user confusion about whether their setup is correct.
