## Description

## Description

When sending a document/file via WhatsApp using the message tool, the recipient sees a generic "file" label instead of the actual filename — even when the `filename` parameter is explicitly set.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Use the message tool to send a file via WhatsApp:
   ```
   message send --target +123... --message "caption" --filePath /tmp/my-report.txt --filename my-report.txt
   ```
2. Recipient sees: "file · 8 KB · txt" with no filename

## Root Cause

In `dist/web/outbound.js`, the `sendMessageWhatsApp` function loads the media file and passes `mediaBuffer` and `mediaType` to `active.sendMessage()`, but the `filename` parameter (which is correctly resolved in `dist/infra/outbound/message-action-runner.js`) is never forwarded to the WhatsApp Web send layer.

The `sendMessage` call:
```js
await active.sendMessage(to, text, mediaBuffer, mediaType, sendOptions)
```

...does not include a filename in `sendOptions` or as a separate parameter.

## Expected Behavior

The filename should be passed through to WhatsApp so the recipient sees the actual file name (e.g., "my-report.txt") instead of "file".
