some error messages also leak to whatsapp chats.

Got the same here, with Telegram config! Did you configure claude models with your pro/max account token ? Maybe Anthopic finds a way to block this without banning user ??

Yeah.  Pro/max account. Was working at first and then started flaking out this morning.  You may be right, they may be programmatically blocking.  And API is cost prohibitive when testing something new like this. My first 8 hours were amazing. now I am stuck
