## Description

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I am running a multi-agent setup (e.g., separate agents for "Investment" and "General Management") on a single Clawdbot Gateway.
Currently, the `discord` plugin configuration only accepts a single `token` string. This means all agents must share the same Discord Bot User (same avatar and name), even if I route them to different channels.

The Gateway architecture clearly supports multiple accounts per channel (as seen in the `whatsapp` plugin's `accounts` map), but the Discord plugin implementation seems to lag behind this capability.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Update the `discord` plugin configuration schema to support an `accounts` map (similar to WhatsApp), allowing multiple Bot Tokens to be configured and bound to different `accountId`s.

Example config structure:
```json
"channels": {
  "discord": {
    "accounts": {
      "bot_a": { "token": "..." },
      "bot_b": { "token": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

This would allow routing rules like:
- Bind `agent:si_ya` -> Discord Account A (Bot A)
- Bind `agent:si_lan` -> Discord Account B (Bot B)

## Describe alternatives you've considered

Currently, the only workaround is running multiple Clawdbot Gateway instances (one per bot token) on different ports, which is resource-heavy and harder to manage.
