## Description

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- Node.js: 24.13.0
- OS: Ubuntu Linux (Azure VM)
- Telegram bot: @disiermoltbot

## Problem
Telegram bot can **send messages** but **cannot receive** any messages from users. Polling appears to start but never receives updates.

## What works
- ✅ `getMe` returns bot info correctly
- ✅ `sendMessage` successfully delivers messages to users
- ✅ WhatsApp channel works perfectly on same gateway
- ✅ Bot token is valid (freshly regenerated)

## What doesn't work
- ❌ Bot never receives user messages
- ❌ `getUpdates` always returns `{"ok":true,"result":[]}`
- ❌ No Telegram inbound messages appear in logs

## Configuration
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "[REDACTED]"
    }
  }
}

**Logs**
gateway/channels/telegram [default] starting provider (@disiermoltbot)
telegram/network telegram: autoSelectFamily=false (default-node22)
No inbound messages ever appear after provider starts.

**Steps to reproduce**
Fresh install of OpenClaw 2026.2.1
Configure Telegram with valid bot token via openclaw channels add --channel telegram --token "..."
Restart gateway
Send /start to bot from Telegram
Bot never responds, no inbound message in logs
What I've tried
Regenerated bot token multiple times
Set dmPolicy: "open" and allowFrom: ["*"]
Deleted webhook with deleteWebhook?drop_pending_updates=true
Killed all processes and restarted
Upgraded from clawdbot 2026.1.24-3 to openclaw 2026.2.1
Removed and re-added Telegram channel config
Additional context
When manually calling getUpdates via curl while gateway is running, I get 409 conflict (expected)
This suggests polling IS running, but it's not receiving any messages
The autoSelectFamily=false log entry might be related?
