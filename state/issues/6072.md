## Description

## Description

After macOS wakes from sleep, the OpenClaw gateway's Telegram connection becomes stale and doesn't automatically reconnect. Messages sent to the bot aren't received until running `openclaw doctor --fix` (which restarts the gateway).

## Environment
- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- OpenClaw 2026.1.29
- Telegram channel configured with long-polling

## Logs

From `gateway.err.log`:
```
[telegram] [default] channel exited: Request to 'getUpdates' timed out after 500 seconds
```

The gateway process stays running (so launchd's `KeepAlive` doesn't trigger), but the Telegram polling loop appears to be dead.

## Expected Behavior

The gateway should detect the stale connection (network change, timeout, etc.) and automatically reconnect to Telegram.

## Workaround

Using `sleepwatcher` with a `~/.wakeup` script that runs `openclaw gateway restart`.

## Notes

This is a regression — the previous Clawdbot gateway handled sleep/wake gracefully without manual intervention.

## Related

The gateway may need to:
1. Detect network state changes (via macOS APIs or polling)
2. Have more aggressive timeout/reconnect logic for the Telegram long-polling
3. Expose a lightweight `/health` or `/reconnect` endpoint for wake scripts
