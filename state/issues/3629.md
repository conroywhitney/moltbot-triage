## Description

## Description
When `/reasoning on` is enabled, the reasoning message often arrives **after** the main reply in Telegram, instead of before.

## Root Cause
In `pi-embedded-subscribe.handlers.messages.js`, line ~164:
```javascript
void onBlockReply?.({ text: formattedReasoning });  // fire-and-forget

The void makes it fire-and-forget. The main reply is sent immediately after without awaiting, causing a race condition.

**Expected**: Reasoning message arrives first, then the answer.

**Actual**: Order is random; answer often comes first.
