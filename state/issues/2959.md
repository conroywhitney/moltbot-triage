## Description

When using the Clawdbot Chat view, my messages always appear twice (duplicated) and assistant replies are created as entries but render with no text content (blank assistant messages). The gateway health indicator shows “Health OK”, and the UI loads normally, but the assistant response content never appears.

I’m using OpenAI via API (ChatGPT / GPT-5.2 via OpenAI API key) as the model provider. Saw a reddit post of 5 months ago about ChatGPT, that they could not see the response. Is that the problem?

Clawdbot/Moltbot version: Latest release as of 2026-01-27 (installed today)

OS (server): Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on Hetzner VPS
OS (client): Windows (PowerShell + web browser Brave)
Install method: VPS install (manual install following docs / YouTube guide); gateway accessed via SSH port-forward (ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 ...)
Youtube video was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhjK2Gr0Ryc

Browser: First Brave. Tried on Chrome as well, but the same issue. (i tried with ctrl+shift+R, no change)


Can someone help? 

Thanks!

I added /v1 after the baseUrl of the third-party OpenAI provider in clawdbot.json, and then there was a response. For example: ... "api_codex": {
"baseUrl": "https://api-api_codex.com/v1",...
