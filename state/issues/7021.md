## Description

Add a new memory plugin (memory-powermem) that uses PowerMem as OpenClaw’s semantic memory backend. The goal is to replace the current local SQLite-based semantic index/search (memory-core) with PowerMem’s hybrid retrieval + intelligent memory capabilities, while preserving OpenClaw’s existing workspace Markdown memory files as the primary authoring/source-of-truth surface.

## Motivation
OpenClaw’s current memory experience is file-first and works well, but the semantic retrieval layer is tightly coupled to a local SQLite index, embedding providers, and platform-specific vector acceleration (sqlite-vec). PowerMem provides:
- hybrid retrieval (dense + full-text + graph) and better recall
- optional intelligent extraction/dedup/conflict resolution
- multi-agent isolation and sharing primitives
We want OpenClaw to benefit from PowerMem’s memory engine without changing the user-facing memory workflow (Markdown in workspace).

## Background (current OpenClaw behavior)
1. Memory files:
- MEMORY.md (curated long-term memory; loaded only in main/private session)
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (daily log; loaded on start)
2. Tools:
- memory_search: returns snippets with path + line ranges + score
- memory_get: reads a specific memory file safely
- Semantic index is currently built and stored per agent in SQLite and updated via file watchers.

## Proposed Solution
1. Add a new plugin: memory-powermem
1) Plugin kind: memory
2) Provides:
- memory_search (required)
- memory_get (required)
- openclaw memory status|index|search CLI parity (recommended)

2. Integration mode: “File-backed, PowerMem-powered search”
Keep OpenClaw’s Markdown files as the canonical surface, but use PowerMem for retrieval:
- Ingestion: chunk OpenClaw memory markdown into stable chunks and upsert them into PowerMem
- Search: call PowerMem then map results back to: workspace path (from stored metadata)startLine/endLine (from stored metadata)
- Read: memory_get continues reading from local workspace files (existing safety boundaries)
This preserves the current UX and makes PowerMem a drop-in replacement for semantic search.
