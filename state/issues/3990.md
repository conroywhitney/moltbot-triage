## Description

## Summary
Egress webhooks (Clawdbot → external URLs when events fire)

```
# Example: Notify external system on message_sent
egressWebhooks:
  messageSent:
    - url: "http://192.168.1.100:8080/reaction"
      method: POST
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer SECRET"
      bodyTemplate: "{{json .}}"
  
  toolCallStarted:
    - url: "http://my-screen.local/loading"
      method: POST
```

Security considerations:
Token auth for webhook endpoints
Retry logic for failed deliveries
Rate limiting to prevent spam
Disable via config (egressWebhooks.enabled: false)

Example in CC:
https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks - they have both ingress AND egress hooks. Point out the similarity!


## Proposed solution
Have a way to hook it into other things without explicitly just having to use tool calls within the LLM itself


Since the previous issue was closed ([due to 3 days of inactivity?](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/issues/1382#issuecomment-3817657929)) I will look to open a PR myself to address this in the coming days
