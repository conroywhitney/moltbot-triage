## Description

## Summary

What went wrong? 

Silent failure on attempting to read large screenshots. 

## Steps to reproduce

1. Ask a claude instance to use screen read features.
2. If the screenshot is too large, it breaks Claude Code context window and the session can't continue. 
3. This is actually a bug from Claude's end, it should gracefully reject images over a certain size. But once the context breaks, it's irrecoverable. The failure is silent in Open Claw.
4. Open Claw dashboard will return empty string messages with no error description when this happens.

## Expected behavior

What did you expect to happen?

Minimum: report error + context refresh

Ideal: gate image size + create basic conversion script.

## Actual behavior

What actually happened?

Silent failure with chat returning empty strings.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30 (8469)
- OS: Sequoia 15.7.3
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npm
