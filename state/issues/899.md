## Description

Tracker for upcoming secret‑scanning redaction work

**Goal:** To give knobs such that clawdbot can be configured to redact/block provider messages or LLM API calls that might contain secrets, high entropy data or other sensitive information

We will for the first step,

- [ ] PR 1: Refactor detection/redaction logic into a separate module
  - add more ways to detect and redact, like entropy
    - Entropy detection (base64/hex‑ish high‑entropy strings)
    - Heuristic filters (placeholders, UUIDs, templating, hashes, etc.)
  - add tests right away
- [ ] PR 2: Wire it up in places (will plan this step after the first PR is merged


Inspired by https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets. Let me know if you prefer using a library vs having a basic implementation on the repo

Biggest JS/TS secret detection project: https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint

Current Q: should we use it directly, hack it for parts, vendor it, implement detection logic from scratch, or sth else?

One thing I noticed, entropy detection and heuristic detection from detect-secrets could be too strict because it triggers really a lot in our other repo. But I would for sure prefer a detect-secrets style redaction on an enterprise setting
