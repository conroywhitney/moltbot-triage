## Description

## Summary

We've received multiple requests and PRs for internationalization (i18n) and localization support. We appreciate the community's interest in making Moltbot accessible to more users worldwide!

**However, we don't currently have the bandwidth to properly support multiple languages.**

## Why we're consolidating this

- Maintaining translations requires ongoing effort as the product evolves
- We need to establish a proper i18n architecture first
- Quality translations need review by native speakers
- Documentation, error messages, and UI all need coordinated translation

## What this means

- **New PRs adding translations will be closed** and pointed to this issue
- **Issues requesting specific languages will be closed** as duplicates of this one
- When we're ready, we'll announce the i18n initiative here

## Languages requested (tracking)

- [ ] Chinese (Simplified) - zh-CN
- [ ] Chinese (Traditional) - zh-TW  
- [ ] Portuguese (Brazilian) - pt-BR
- [ ] Korean - ko
- [ ] Japanese - ja
- [ ] Spanish - es
- [ ] French - fr
- [ ] German - de
- [ ] Vietnamese - vi
- [ ] Filipino - fi

**Want to add a language?** Comment below and we'll add it to the list.

## Timeline

No ETA yet. We'll update this issue when we're ready to start accepting i18n contributions.

*This is the canonical issue for all i18n/localization requests. Thank you for your patience!*

## Comments

### @sebslight (2026-01-29)

Adding Vietnamese (vi) to the tracking list per PR #3554.

### @kenuoseclab (2026-01-29)

Chinese (Simplified) - zh-CN


### @thewilloftheshadow (2026-01-29)

Please do not link other implementations, we cannot verify them and this project carries too much of a security risk for that.

### @superssr (2026-01-29)

Hi! We have a complete i18n implementation ready when you're accepting contributions:

**Stats:**
- 274 translation keys
- 9 languages: EN, ZH, JA, KO, ES, FR, DE, PT, RU
- Full Control UI coverage (~96%)
- Type-safe with TypeScript

**Architecture:**
- Lightweight runtime (no heavy deps)
- Proxy-based lazy loading
- Language switcher component
- Follows your existing code patterns

Branch: `feat/i18n-chinese-support` at [superssr/moltbot](https://github.com/superssr/moltbot/tree/feat/i18n-chinese-support)

Happy to adapt to whatever i18n architecture you establish. Just let us know!

### @superssr (2026-01-29)

Also happy to help design the i18n architecture itself if that would be useful. Our implementation includes:

- Runtime translation function `t()` with dot-notation keys
- Type-safe key validation
- Nested JSON structure for organization
- Proxy-based section metadata (lazy translation)
- Browser locale detection + manual override
- Persistent language preference

Can provide an RFC or discuss architecture decisions if the team is interested.

### @MarriotZ (2026-01-30)

If it's possible, I’d like to contribute to the Chinese part, maintaining translations for docs/UI, updating release notes, and helping with community support while keeping everything synced with upstream changes.

### @is52hertz (2026-01-30)

I think using the **Crowdin** platform to let the community maintain translations is a great way to do it.
Modrinth et al. used this method and achieved remarkable results.
It allows easy review, submission, confirmation of translations, and engages the entire community, including native speakers.

### @felirami (2026-01-30)

Hi! I’m a native Spanish speaker and happy to help translate or review es strings when the i18n effort begins. Please tag me when you’re ready.

### @warengonzaga (2026-01-30)

Let's add Filipino - fil

### @warengonzaga (2026-01-30)

I can contribute and translate it into my native language.

### @olwater (2026-01-30)

I completely understand the concern about maintenance overhead at this early stage. My primary motivation for proposing this now is to prevent 'hardcoding debt.' It is significantly easier to establish a translation pattern while the codebase is still manageable than to refactor hundreds of hardcoded strings later. This PR is designed to be non-invasive and 100% backward compatible—it provides the foundation for international growth without slowing down core development.

I’m happy to simplify the implementation further if it helps, but I believe setting the standard early will benefit the project's long-term scalability. What do you think?
