## Description

## Summary

We've received multiple requests and PRs for internationalization (i18n) and localization support. We appreciate the community's interest in making Moltbot accessible to more users worldwide!

**However, we don't currently have the bandwidth to properly support multiple languages.**

## Why we're consolidating this

- Maintaining translations requires ongoing effort as the product evolves
- We need to establish a proper i18n architecture first
- Quality translations need review by native speakers
- Documentation, error messages, and UI all need coordinated translation

## What this means

- **New PRs adding translations will be closed** and pointed to this issue
- **Issues requesting specific languages will be closed** as duplicates of this one
- When we're ready, we'll announce the i18n initiative here

## Languages requested (tracking)

- [ ] Chinese (Simplified) - zh-CN
- [ ] Chinese (Traditional) - zh-TW  
- [ ] Portuguese (Brazilian) - pt-BR
- [ ] Korean - ko
- [ ] Japanese - ja
- [ ] Spanish - es
- [ ] French - fr
- [ ] German - de
- [ ] Vietnamese - vi

**Want to add a language?** Comment below and we'll add it to the list.

## Timeline

No ETA yet. We'll update this issue when we're ready to start accepting i18n contributions.

*This is the canonical issue for all i18n/localization requests. Thank you for your patience!*

### @sebslight (2026-01-29)

Adding Vietnamese (vi) to the tracking list per PR #3554.

### @kenuoseclab (2026-01-29)

Chinese (Simplified) - zh-CN


### @thewilloftheshadow (2026-01-29)

Please do not link other implementations, we cannot verify them and this project carries too much of a security risk for that.

### @superssr (2026-01-29)

Hi! We have a complete i18n implementation ready when you're accepting contributions:

**Stats:**
- 274 translation keys
- 9 languages: EN, ZH, JA, KO, ES, FR, DE, PT, RU
- Full Control UI coverage (~96%)
- Type-safe with TypeScript

**Architecture:**
- Lightweight runtime (no heavy deps)
- Proxy-based lazy loading
- Language switcher component
- Follows your existing code patterns

Branch: `feat/i18n-chinese-support` at [superssr/moltbot](https://github.com/superssr/moltbot/tree/feat/i18n-chinese-support)

Happy to adapt to whatever i18n architecture you establish. Just let us know!

### @superssr (2026-01-29)

Also happy to help design the i18n architecture itself if that would be useful. Our implementation includes:

- Runtime translation function `t()` with dot-notation keys
- Type-safe key validation
- Nested JSON structure for organization
- Proxy-based section metadata (lazy translation)
- Browser locale detection + manual override
- Persistent language preference

Can provide an RFC or discuss architecture decisions if the team is interested.
