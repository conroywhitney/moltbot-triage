## Description

## Problem

When using the `/restart` command or `gateway.restart` tool action on Windows, the restart fails silently with `unsupported platform restart`.

The current implementation in `dist/infra/restart.js` only supports:
- **macOS**: via `launchctl kickstart`
- **Linux**: via `systemctl restart`

On Windows, the function returns early:
```javascript
if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    if (process.platform === 'linux') {
        // systemd restart
    }
    return {
        ok: false,
        method: 'supervisor',
        detail: 'unsupported platform restart',
    };
}
```

Additionally, the SIGUSR1 signal approach doesn't work on Windows as Windows doesn't support Unix signals.

## Expected Behavior

Gateway should restart cleanly on Windows, similar to macOS/Linux.

## Suggested Solution

For Windows, consider:

1. **Using a wrapper script approach:**
   ```powershell
   # Stop gateway
   openclaw gateway stop
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
   # Start gateway in background
   Start-Process -FilePath "openclaw" -ArgumentList "gateway", "start" -WindowStyle Hidden
   ```

2. **Or spawning a detached child process** that waits for the parent to exit, then restarts the gateway.

3. **Or using Windows Task Scheduler** for a one-shot restart task (similar to launchctl approach on macOS).

## Workaround

Created a manual restart script that works:
```powershell
# restart-openclaw.ps1
openclaw gateway stop
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
$orphan = Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 18789 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($orphan) { Stop-Process -Id $orphan.OwningProcess -Force }
Start-Process -FilePath "openclaw" -ArgumentList "gateway", "start" -WindowStyle Hidden
```

## Environment

- OS: Windows 11 (10.0.26200)
