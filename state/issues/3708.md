## Description

## Environment
- **OS:** macOS 15.5 (Build 24F74)
- **Node.js:** v22.16.0
- **Moltbot:** 2026.1.27-beta.1

## Summary

The gateway scans the entire `skills/` directory tree on startup, opens every file inside `.venv` (thousands of Python packages), and never closes the file handles. This causes immediate FD exhaustion (~11,000 open FDs) and `spawn EBADF` on any subsequent exec call.

## Evidence

```bash
# Immediately after fresh gateway start — already leaked:
lsof -p $(pgrep -f moltbot-gateway) | wc -l
# → 11,084

# 99.7% from .venv:
lsof -p $(pgrep -f moltbot-gateway) | grep '\.venv' | wc -l
# → 11,024

# FD type breakdown:
lsof -p $(pgrep -f moltbot-gateway) | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5
# → 11,055 REG (regular files)
# →    10 PIPE
# →     7 IPv4

# Top directories scanned:
# pygments/lexers (259), matplotlib (141), jedi/typeshed (133), PIL (114), pandas/tests (80)
```

## Comparison

| State | Open FDs | exec |
|-------|----------|------|
| Gateway without `.venv` in skills dir | ~42 | ✅ works |
| Gateway with `.venv` in skills dir | ~11,084 | ❌ spawn EBADF |

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a skill with a Python `.venv` directory (e.g. `~/clawd/skills/invest/.venv`)
2. Start the gateway (`moltbot gateway install`)
3. Any exec tool call → `spawn EBADF`

## Expected

Gateway should exclude `.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, and other common dependency directories when indexing skills.

## Workaround

Move `.venv` out of the skill directory:

```bash
mv ~/clawd/skills/invest/.venv ~/clawd/.venv-invest-backup
moltbot gateway stop && moltbot gateway install
```

## Additional Data: Skill Scanner FD Leak (no .venv)

Confirming the FD leak affects **all skill files**, not just `.venv`. Our setup has no `.venv` in skills, yet 100% of files are held open.

### Environment
- OS: Darwin 25.2.0 (arm64)
- Node: v22.22.0
- Moltbot: 2026.1.24-3

### Evidence

```
Files on disk in skills/:   99
Files held open by gateway: 99  (100%)
```

**No `.venv` present** — the leak is in the general skill scanner, not specific to Python environments.

### Breakdown by file type
```
58 .md files held open
23 .sh scripts held open
 6 .json held open
 5 .js held open
 4 .py held open
```

### Impact
- Each skill file = 1 leaked FD
- Gateway starts with ~100-200 FDs already consumed
- Combined with PTY leaks (~3 FDs/command), eventually hits EBADF

### Workarounds that reduced leak
1. Moved large skill directory out of skills/ (40 files)
2. Deleted `.git/` directories from clawdhub-installed skills (28 files)
3. Deleted `.clawdhub/origin.json` metadata files (18 files)
4. Deleted `package-lock.json` files (1 file)

**Result: 185 → 99 files, FDs reduced from 219 → 162**

### Suggested fix
The skill scanner should:
1. Read file contents into memory
2. **Close the file handle immediately**
3. Continue processing with in-memory data

Currently it appears to hold handles open for the lifetime of the gateway process.

### @kylehowells (2026-01-30)

This seems to be a known issue because the repo already has an exclude list for node modules, bit not venv.
Added a PR to add venv alongside the node modules, but wonder if something like the above would be able to fix it long term. From you understanding it wants to keep monitoring the skills directory for changes because it supports live updates and reloading or any changes to skills. #3845
