## Description

## The idea

Allow Clawdbot nodes to operate as autonomous peers rather than purely as execution relays for a central gateway. Think mesh topology vs. star topology.

## Current architecture

One gateway owns all state, sessions, channels, and LLM routing. Nodes are execution endpoints — they can run commands and proxy browser control, but have no independent agency.

## Proposed evolution

- **Offline resilience** — A node with a local LLM (e.g., LM Studio/Ollama) could continue serving as an assistant when the central gateway or cloud APIs are unreachable. When connectivity resumes, it syncs state back.
- **Edge-first processing** — Simple queries get handled locally (fast, free, private), complex ones escalate to cloud models. The node decides based on task complexity.
- **State sync** — Sessions, memory files, and context replicate across nodes (conflict-free, eventually consistent). Your laptop, home server, and phone all share continuity.
- **Failover** — If the gateway goes down, a node promotes itself to handle channels temporarily. No single point of failure.
- **Privacy tiers** — Sensitive tasks stay on local hardware, general tasks go to cloud. The routing is policy-driven, not all-or-nothing.

## Why it matters

The current hub-and-spoke model works well for single-user setups, but as people connect more devices (server + laptop + phone), the central gateway becomes both a bottleneck and a single point of failure. A mesh model would make Clawdbot genuinely resilient and privacy-aware.

## Prior art

CRDTs for state sync, libp2p for peer discovery, Tailscale for the network layer (already integrated).
