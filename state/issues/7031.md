## Description

**Problem:**
Many organizations use Microsoft 365 (Teams, Outlook, etc.) but do not have an Azure subscription. The current Teams integration requires:
1. Azure Bot resource (requires Azure subscription)
2. App registration in Azure Portal
3. Complex setup with credentials and messaging endpoints

This creates a barrier for M365-only users who want to integrate OpenClaw with Teams.

**Requested Feature:**
Provide a simpler Teams integration path for organizations without Azure subscriptions, such as:
1. OAuth-only authentication flow (similar to Google/Slack)
2. Pre-configured shared bot infrastructure (OpenClaw-hosted)
3. Browser-based fallback that persists authentication

**Use Case:**
- Company has Microsoft 365 Business/Enterprise license
- No Azure subscription or budget for Azure services
- Wants OpenClaw to monitor Teams channels and respond to mentions
- Currently must use browser automation as workaround

**Alternative Workarounds Considered:**
- Browser automation works but requires keeping browser open and logged in
- Azure free trial requires credit card and has limitations
- Creating Azure subscription requires IT/management approval + budget

**Impact:**
Would make Teams integration accessible to a much larger user base who use M365 for business but don't need full Azure services.
