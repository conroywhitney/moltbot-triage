## Description
The OpenClaw logo image on the gateway dashboard is broken, displaying a "broken image" placeholder instead of the intended `pixel-lobster.svg` graphic.

## Environment
- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.1.30
- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 24.6.0, arm64)
- **Node:** v25.5.0
- **Gateway Mode:** local
- **Gateway Port:** 18789

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start OpenClaw gateway (`openclaw gateway start`)
2. Access the gateway dashboard at `http://localhost:18789` (or configured port)
3. Observe the broken image where the OpenClaw logo should appear

## Expected Behavior
The pixel lobster logo should display properly.

## Actual Behavior
Broken image icon displayed with the following HTML:
```html
<img src="https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE&q=85&s=da2032e9eac3b5d9bfe7eb96ca6a8a26" alt="OpenClaw">
```

When fetched, the URL returns:
```
sig_invalid
```

## Root Cause
The image URL uses a signed CDN link from `mintcdn.com` with an expired signature parameter (`s=da2032e9eac3b5d9bfe7eb96ca6a8a26`). Signed URLs have time-based expiration for security, but static UI assets shouldn't use expiring signatures.

## Impact
- **Severity:** Low (cosmetic only)
- **User Experience:** Creates visual clutter with broken image placeholder
- **Functionality:** No functional impact, purely aesthetic

## Evidence
```bash
$ curl -s "https://mintcdn.com/clawhub/4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE/assets/pixel-lobster.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=4rYvG-uuZrMK_URE&q=85&s=da2032e9eac3b5d9bfe7eb96ca6a8a26"
sig_invalid
```

## Suggested Fixes

### Option 1: Use Local Assets (Recommended)
Bundle the `pixel-lobster.svg` file with the OpenClaw distribution and serve it from the local gateway:
```html
<img src="/assets/pixel-lobster.svg" alt="OpenClaw">
```

### Option 2: Use Non-Expiring CDN URL
If CDN delivery is preferred, use a non-signed public URL for static branding assets.

### Option 3: Regenerate Signature
Dynamically generate fresh signed URLs when the gateway starts, though this is overkill for a static logo.

## Additional Notes
- This is the only broken image detected on the dashboard
- While purely cosmetic, it's visually distracting for daily users
- The issue affects all installations using the same hardcoded CDN URL

## Workaround
None needed - functionality is unaffected. Users can safely ignore the broken image.
