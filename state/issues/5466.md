## Description

## Description
Browser tool actions (`browser start`, `browser open`, `browser snapshot`) time out with "Can't reach the openclaw browser control service (timed out after 15000ms)" on a headless Linux VM.

## Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.1.29
- OS: Ubuntu Core 24 (VMware VM, no display)
- Browser: Chromium 144.0.7559.96 (snap package)
- Node: v22.22.0

## Config
```json
{
  "browser": {
    "enabled": true,
    "headless": true,
    "noSandbox": true
  }
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run OpenClaw gateway on headless Linux (no DISPLAY)
2. `openclaw browser start --browser-profile openclaw`
3. Observe 15s timeout

## Diagnosis
- `playwright-core` launches Chromium successfully when tested directly:
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright-core');
chromium.launch({ 
  executablePath: '/snap/bin/chromium',
  headless: true,
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-gpu']
}).then(b => console.log('Success!', b.version()));
// Output: Success! 144.0.7559.96
```
- `openclaw browser status` works and shows correct config
- `openclaw browser tabs` sometimes works (returns empty array)
- Actual browser launch/control times out internally in the gateway

## Expected
Browser should launch in headless mode and be controllable via the browser tool.

## Workarounds Attempted
- Set `executablePath` to `/snap/bin/chromium` (snap wrapper)
- Set `cdpUrl` to manually started browser with `--remote-debugging-port=18800`
- Set `attachOnly: true`
- Manually launched chromium with CDP - curl to `/json/version` works

None resolved the gateway-internal timeout.

## Additional Context
The `/usr/bin/chromium-browser` path is a shell wrapper that redirects to `/snap/bin/chromium`. Both paths work with playwright-core directly but not through OpenClaw's browser control service.

### @feliscat (2026-02-01)

I have the same problem on ubuntu 24.04 with chrome installed from apt.

### @langered (2026-02-01)

I had the same issue. Installing the official deb package and updating the config as described here fixed it for me:

### @AnLuoRidge (2026-02-02)

This is likely the [fix](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6961).
