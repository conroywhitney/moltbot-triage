## Description

## Description
In the macOS app's Settings → General, when you clear the SSH target field and save, the field auto-repopulates with the previous value.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open Clawdbot macOS app
2. Go to Settings → General
3. Set "Clawdbot runs" to "Remote over SSH"
4. Enter an SSH target (e.g., `user@host`)
5. Clear the SSH target field (delete all text)
6. Click away or close settings
7. Reopen settings

## Expected behavior
The SSH target field should remain empty.

## Actual behavior
The SSH target field is repopulated with the previous value.

## Root cause
`AppState.applyConfigOverrides()` calls `updateRemoteTarget()` whenever the config file changes. This function extracts the host from `gateway.remote.url` and repopulates `remoteTarget`, overwriting user edits (including clearing the field).

This creates a feedback loop:
1. User clears field → UI updates
2. Config file is written
3. Config watcher triggers `applyConfigOverrides()`
4. `updateRemoteTarget()` repopulates the field from `gateway.remote.url`

## Related
PR #2046 fixed a similar issue with username overwriting but didn't address this config watcher feedback loop.

## Environment
- macOS app
- Any version with remote SSH mode
