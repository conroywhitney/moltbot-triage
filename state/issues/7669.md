## Description

## Summary

Re-enable the `dev` channel for npm distribution, as documented at https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/development-channels.

## Background

Development channels allow users to install packages from different release stages:

- **stable**: Tagged releases (vYYYY.M.D or vYYYY.M.D-\<patch\>), npm dist-tag `latest`
- **beta**: Prerelease tags (vYYYY.M.D-beta.N), npm dist-tag `beta`
- **dev**: Moving head of main branch, npm dist-tag `dev`

Reference: https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/development-channels

According to the documentation:
> dev: moving head of main, npm dist-tag dev (when published).

## Current State

The `dev` channel appears to be disabled or not currently published. Users cannot install from the dev channel:
```bash
npm install -g openclaw@dev
# `dev` tag is missing
```

## Task

1. **Verify CI/CD configuration** for dev channel publishing
2. **Re-enable dev dist-tag** on main branch builds
3. **Add verification** that dev channel is being published correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI/CD publishes `dev` dist-tag on main branch builds
- [ ] `npm view openclaw@dev` shows recent version from main
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects current channel status
