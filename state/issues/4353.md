## Description

## Description

The Clawdbot macOS app (v2026.1.23, build 7750) crashes immediately on launch with a fatal error in `Bundle.module` for the `Textual` Swift package.

## Crash Details

```
Fatal error: could not load resource bundle: from /Applications/Clawdbot.app/textual_Textual.bundle or /Users/steipete/Projects/clawdbot4/apps/macos/.build/arm64/arm64-apple-macosx/release/textual_Textual.bundle
```

**Stack trace:**
```
Thread 0 Crashed (com.apple.main-thread):
  _assertionFailure → NSBundle.module (closure #1) →
  CodeTokenizer.init() →
  HighlightedTextFragment.Model.tokenize() →
  HighlightedTextFragment.body.getter
```

## Root Cause

The `Textual` SPM package's auto-generated `Bundle.module` accessor looks for `textual_Textual.bundle` at the app bundle root (`/Applications/Clawdbot.app/textual_Textual.bundle`), but the bundle is actually at `/Applications/Clawdbot.app/Contents/Resources/textual_Textual.bundle`.

This is a Swift Package Manager resource bundle path resolution issue in the release build.

## Environment

- macOS 26.2 (25C56)
- MacBookAir10,1 (Apple M1, 8GB)
- Clawdbot v2026.1.23 (build 7750)
- Installed via Homebrew Cask

## Workaround Attempted

Creating a symlink from the app root to `Contents/Resources/textual_Textual.bundle` is blocked by SIP/code signing on the notarized app bundle.

## Suggested Fix

The `Bundle.module` accessor in the Textual package needs to resolve the correct path within the app's `Contents/Resources/` directory for release builds.
