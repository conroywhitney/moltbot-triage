## Description

## Description

The Clawdbot web UI control panel shows an error when viewing the Nodes section:

```
Accounts Unsupported schema node. Use Raw mode.
```

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Clawdbot web UI
2. Navigate to Nodes section
3. Error appears for 'Accounts' config

## Expected Behavior

UI should render the Accounts schema node properly, or gracefully handle unsupported nodes.

## Environment

- Clawdbot running on VPS (Linux)
- Accessed via web control UI

## Notes

Raw mode works fine - this is just a UI rendering issue, not a functional problem.
