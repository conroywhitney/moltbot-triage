## Description

## Summary
Companion app will crash whenever the icon is clicked

michaltoth@mba15mt clawdbot % /Applications/Clawdbot.app/Contents/MacOS/Clawdbot 
Textual/resource_bundle_accessor.swift:12: Fatal error: could not load resource bundle: from /Applications/Clawdbot.app/textual_Textual.bundle or /Users/steipete/Projects/clawdbot4/apps/macos/.build/arm64/arm64-apple-macosx/release/textual_Textual.bundle


## Steps to reproduce
1. brew install --cask clawbot
2. start the companion app (with gateway)
3. left click on the taskbar icon to expand it

behavior can be observed by starting the app from command line

## Expected behavior
Well, i expected it not to crash :-)

## Actual behavior
the bundle is actually in the app, but you need create a fake homedir for steipete and link it there (the hardcoded build path as mentioned above)

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.23
- OS: mac OS
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): brew

## Comments

### @tralves (2026-01-28)

This also affects the DMG version (Version 2026.1.23 (7750)), not just the brew cask install.

The bundle exists at `/Applications/Clawdbot.app/Contents/Resources/textual_Textual.bundle` but the app is looking for it at `/Applications/Clawdbot.app/textual_Textual.bundle`.
