## Description

Description
When using WhatsApp channel, I can send polls (via message tool / gateway), but there is no supported way to retrieve poll results/votes or receive vote events back into the session. The `message` tool reports `action=read` not supported for whatsapp, and there is no `poll results`/`poll vote` tool/API exposed.

Expected
- Some way to fetch poll results for a given poll messageId (or runId), OR
- Emit poll update/vote events into the session stream when users vote, similar to other inbound message events.

Why it matters
Polls are useful for UX (A/B and multi-choice), but without reading results, the agent can’t act on user votes unless the user manually sends a follow-up message.

Repro
1) Send a WhatsApp poll to self/DM/group.
2) User votes.
3) No vote event is observable; no API/tool exists to query results for the poll message.

Notes
This may require wiring Baileys poll updates (if available) into the gateway event stream, and exposing a tool/API method like `whatsapp.pollResults(messageId)` or similar.
