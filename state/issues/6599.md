## Description

## Summary

Add a command to test that the model fallback chain is correctly configured and working, without waiting for a real failure.

## Motivation

Currently, there's no way to verify fallback configuration works until an actual provider failure occurs. This makes it hard to:

1. Confirm fallback models are correctly configured and accessible
2. Verify API keys/auth profiles for fallback providers are valid
3. Debug fallback issues proactively rather than discovering them during outages

## Proposed Solution

A command like `/models test-fallback` that:

1. Intentionally skips the primary model
2. Attempts a simple request to the first fallback model
3. Reports success/failure and which model responded

Could also support `/models test-fallback --all` to test the entire chain.

## Alternatives Considered

- Manually breaking the primary auth to force fallback (disruptive)
- Spawning a subagent with an invalid primary model (doesn't test the actual fallback mechanism)
- Trusting the config and waiting for natural failures (reactive, not proactive)

## Additional Context

Related PRs working on fallback improvements:
- #6381 - trigger fallback chain on unknown model errors
- #4217 - validate model names in fallbacks commands
- #3253 - per-model fallbacks support
