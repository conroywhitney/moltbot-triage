## Description

## Environment
- OpenClaw Version: 2026.1.29
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0, arm64)
- Node: v25.4.0

## Description
After upgrading from clawdbot to openclaw and restarting the gateway, the cron tool consistently times out after 10-15 seconds.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Upgrade from clawdbot to openclaw
2. Run `openclaw gateway install` and `openclaw gateway start`
3. Try to use cron tool (e.g., `cron list`)

## Expected Behavior
Cron tool should return job list within reasonable time.

## Actual Behavior
```
Error: gateway timeout after 15000ms
Gateway target: ws://127.0.0.1:18789
Source: local loopback
Config: /Users/clawbot/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Bind: loopback
```

## Notes
- Gateway status shows `RPC probe: ok`
- Main session (Telegram) works fine
- Only cron tool times out
- CLI `openclaw cron list` also times out
- Tried multiple gateway restarts, stop/start cycles
