## Description

## Bug Description

The OpenClaw Gateway fails to send messages to Telegram, receiving messages works fine. The error is consistent:

```
Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!
TypeError: fetch failed at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:14902:13
```

## Environment

- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.2.1
- **Node Version:** v22.22.0
- **OS:** Linux 6.14.0-37-generic (x64)
- **Undici Version:** 7.20.0
- **Telegram Bot:** Token is valid, bot is responsive via direct API calls

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure Telegram channel with valid bot token
2. Try to send message via Gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw message send --channel telegram --target <chat_id> --message "Test"
   ```
3. Error occurs: `Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!`

## Expected Behavior

Message should be sent successfully to Telegram.

## Actual Behavior

Error: `TypeError: fetch failed at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:14902:13`

## Additional Context

- **Receiving messages from Telegram works fine** - the bot can receive and process incoming messages
- **Direct API calls work fine** - using `curl` to Telegram API with the same token works perfectly
- **Error is consistent** for both text messages and media (videos, photos)
- **Gateway service is running** and shows as "OK" in status
- Telegram channel shows as "Enabled" and "OK"

## Logs

```
2026-02-02T19:28:11.822Z debug agent/embedded
2026-02-02T19:28:13.472Z warn [openclaw] Non-fatal unhandled rejection (continuing): TypeError: fetch failed
    at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:14902:13
2026-02-02T19:28:13.474Z error telegram/api telegram sendChatAction failed: Network request for 'sendChatAction' failed!
```

## Possible Causes

- Issue with undici library (Node.js fetch implementation)
- Network/DNS configuration in Gateway
- Proxy or connectivity issue specific to the Gateway process

## Workaround

Using direct `curl` calls to Telegram API works as a temporary workaround.
