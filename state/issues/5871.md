## Description

## Summary

The `openclaw` command takes 17+ seconds to execute even for simple operations like `--help`, `--version`, or invalid commands. This makes the CLI nearly unusable.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install openclaw on a Raspberry Pi 4
2. Run `time openclaw --help` or `time openclaw --version` or even an invalid command!
3. Observe the execution time

## Expected behavior

The `--help` and `--version` flags as well as most commandsshould execute in under 1 second.

## Actual behavior

```bash
openclaw@pi4b:~ $ time openclaw --help
🦞 OpenClaw 2026.1.30 (76b5208) — Less middlemen, more messages.

Usage: openclaw [options] [command]
[... help output ...]

real	0m17.812s
user	0m21.138s
sys	0m1.856s

### @Xallt (2026-02-01)

Same for me on my Hetzner instance, interested what the problem is

### @Xallt (2026-02-01)

My agent fixed it for me ;)
This helped:

```bash
export NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
mkdir -p $NODE_COMPILE_CACHE
```

### @smashmiek (2026-02-01)

I'm having the same issue on Ubuntu.

`openclaw --help` runs quickly.

But commands like `openclaw` and `openclaw status` take at least 15-20s to run.

Additional Diagnostics

I did some profiling on this issue. Here are the findings:

Timing Breakdown
| Step                                      | Time                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ./dist/infra/dotenv.js                    | 204 ms                            |
| ./dist/infra/env.js                       | 37 ms                             |
| ./dist/config/config.js                   | 5,025 ms ← 5+ seconds for config! |
| Plugin loading (killed before completion) | ~15+ seconds                      |
Total: 17-40 seconds for any CLI command, even --version

Root Causes

1. Config loading is pathologically slow — 5+ seconds to parse openclaw.json (likely validating all model definitions with cost info)
2. Eager plugin loading — AWS SDK, Google SDK, Slack SDK, Playwright, etc. all load on every command, not just when needed
3. ES module resolution overhead on ARM + SD card I/O (no SSD option on Pi 4)
4. Double startup penalty — CLI respawns itself to set NODE_OPTIONS, paying the cost twice
Workarounds Tested

OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1 saves ~2-4 seconds but doesn't address the real issue.

Suggested Fix

Lazy-load plugin SDKs. Don't load AWS/Google/Slack/Playwright until those specific subcommands are actually invoked. This would cut CLI time to ~5-7 seconds (still slow, but usable).

Environment: Raspberry Pi 4, SD card (no SSD), 414MB node_modules

### @Nick-Zzz (2026-02-03)

I use RDK x5 meet same problem.

Hope fix this bug ASAP~
