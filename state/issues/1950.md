## Description

**Summary:**
Clawd's setup process is interactive, which makes it incompatible with headless Docker deployment services like Dokploy that don't support CLI interactivity.

**Proposed solution:**
1. Complete support for environment variable-based configuration declaration
2. Documentation on all available environment variables & the required environment variable fields for a minimal working setup

**Alternatives considered:**
- Pre-generating `config.json5` files (works but requires manual setup on host machine before building Docker image)
- Interactive setup (not possible in headless/CI environments)

**Additional context:**
- Use case: Deploying Clawd via Dokploy (Docker-based deployment platform)
- Any automated/CI/CD Docker setup where interactive prompts aren't possible
- Related: `docker-setup.sh` shows the current interactive flow
- Related: CHANGELOG mentions `--accept-risk` flag for `--non-interactive` mode
- Related: `CLAWDBOT_NO_ONBOARD=1` exists but is incomplete

Since ClawdBot can ask questions and receive responses from the user, I cannot see any reason why all the answers needed to get going couldn't be asked by the bot rather than the setup script.

### @Siumauricio (2026-01-30)

I created a guide implemented in dokploy, from the creation of the template to the configuration of a Discord bot and real tests https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/pull/4318
