## Description

### Environment
  - OpenClaw version: Latest (2026.1.29)
  - Gateway running on: RN DC2 server
  - Bot: @Doushushu_bot

  ### Description
  Telegram bot receives messages successfully (shows "typing" indicator), but fails to send replies. The agent processes
   the message but gets stuck during the "compaction" phase.

  ### Steps to Reproduce
  1. Send any message to the bot via Telegram
  2. Bot shows "typing" indicator
  3. Agent processing completes (seen in logs: "embedded run agent end")
  4. Compaction phase starts and retries but never completes
  5. After 2 minutes, typing indicator times out
  6. No reply is sent

  ### Logs
  embedded run agent end: runId=xxx
  embedded run compaction start: runId=xxx
  embedded run compaction retry: runId=xxx
  typing TTL reached (2m); stopping typing indicator

  ### Expected Behavior
  Bot should send reply after agent processing completes.

  ### Actual Behavior
  Bot never sends reply; typing indicator times out after 2 minutes.

  ### Additional Info
  - Gateway status shows Telegram as "OK"
  - Bot token is valid and bot API calls work
  - Issue occurs with all types of messages, not just specific commands
  - This is a blocking issue - messages are received but no replies are sent

Same problem here. In the browser dashboard, the replies to what I wrote are visible almost instantly, but in Telegram nothing arrives after it starts typing.
