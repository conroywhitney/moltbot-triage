## Description

Summary

   When the agent attempts to read a file using the read tool, it passes the parameter as file_path, but the
   tool schema expects path. This causes validation to fail with "must have required property 'path'".

   Steps to reproduce
   1. Create a custom skill with a Python script (e.g., fetch_news.py)
   2. Ask the agent to read the script file to understand or modify it
   3. Agent calls read tool with {"file_path": "C:\\path\\to\\file.py"}
   4. Validation fails

   Expected behavior

   The agent should use the correct parameter name (path) when calling the read tool, or the tool schema
   should accept file_path as an alias.

   Actual behavior

   The agent consistently uses file_path instead of path, causing the read operation to fail every time:

     Validation failed for tool "read":
       - path: must have required property 'path'
     Received arguments:
     {
       "file_path": "C:\Users\linys\clawd\skills\x_ai_tech_news\fetch_news.py"
     }

   The agent retried multiple times with the same incorrect parameter name.

   Environment
   •  Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
   •  OS: Windows 10 (Build 26200)
   •  Install method: npm (global install via npm install -g clawdbot)
   •  Node.js version: v24.4.0

     Completed

     Validation failed for tool "read":
       - path: must have required property 'path'
     Received arguments:
     {
       "file_path": "C:\Users\linys\clawd\skills\x_ai_tech_news\fetch_news.py"
     }

   This happened 3 consecutive times - the agent kept using file_path instead of path.

+1. Clawdbot cannot read the SOULS.md file because of this problem. So it's useless.
