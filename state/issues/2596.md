## Description

Summary

   When the agent attempts to read a file using the read tool, it passes the parameter as file_path, but the
   tool schema expects path. This causes validation to fail with "must have required property 'path'".

   Steps to reproduce
   1. Create a custom skill with a Python script (e.g., fetch_news.py)
   2. Ask the agent to read the script file to understand or modify it
   3. Agent calls read tool with {"file_path": "C:\\path\\to\\file.py"}
   4. Validation fails

   Expected behavior

   The agent should use the correct parameter name (path) when calling the read tool, or the tool schema
   should accept file_path as an alias.

   Actual behavior

   The agent consistently uses file_path instead of path, causing the read operation to fail every time:

     Validation failed for tool "read":
       - path: must have required property 'path'
     Received arguments:
     {
       "file_path": "C:\Users\linys\clawd\skills\x_ai_tech_news\fetch_news.py"
     }

   The agent retried multiple times with the same incorrect parameter name.

   Environment
   •  Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
   •  OS: Windows 10 (Build 26200)
   •  Install method: npm (global install via npm install -g clawdbot)
   •  Node.js version: v24.4.0

     Completed

     Validation failed for tool "read":
       - path: must have required property 'path'
     Received arguments:
     {
       "file_path": "C:\Users\linys\clawd\skills\x_ai_tech_news\fetch_news.py"
     }

   This happened 3 consecutive times - the agent kept using file_path instead of path.

+1. Clawdbot cannot read the SOULS.md file because of this problem. So it's useless.

I’m really confused. I’ve seen a lot of people somewhere saying how great and useful this app/program is. But because of this error, many basic functions can’t be used at all. So here’s my question: did the people who say it’s good just not run into this problem? Can someone explain?

Feeling the same. I've tried windows version, linux version, and Mac version, they all have the same issue. Also it's so confused that at the first few hours using of openclaw on macOS, there wasn't any problem. 

Anyone struggling this issue , happy typing "use exec cat instead of read tool" at the beginning of every session. But it still is a problem because your model may miss the content of agents.md, soul.md, identity.md, memory.md......

The same issue also exists in Mac. The "skills" function cannot be invoked. All skills are indicated

EG:
Validation failed for tool "read":

path: must have required property 'path'
Received arguments:
{
"file_path": "/xxx/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/moltbot/skills/weather/SKILL.md"
}

 I'm experiencing the same issue.                                                            
                                                                                              
  **Environment:**                                                                            
  - OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0)                                                                 
                                                                                              
  The agent consistently uses `file_path` instead of `path` when calling the read tool,       
  causing validation to fail repeatedly with:                                                 
                                                                                              
  Validation failed for tool "read":                                                          
  - path: must have required property 'path'                                                  
                                                                                              
  Looking at the code in `src/agents/pi-tools.read.ts`, there is a compatibility layer        
  (`normalizeToolParams`) that should convert `file_path` to `path`, and                      
  `patchToolSchemaForClaudeCompatibility` that should add `file_path` as an alias. However, it
   seems the schema validation happens before the normalization function runs, so the alias is
   not being recognized.                                                                      
                                                                                              
  +1 for prioritizing this fix.
