## Description

## Feature Request

**Description:**
Add image/media upload support to the webchat gateway dashboard, similar to how Telegram and other channels handle media.

**Current Behavior:**
- No attachment button in webchat UI
- Ctrl+V paste doesn't work for images
- Drag and drop opens a new browser window instead of attaching

**Requested Features:**
1. **Clipboard paste support** (Ctrl+V for screenshots)
2. **Drag & drop** image upload into chat input
3. **Attachment button** for file selection
4. Support for common image formats (jpg, png, gif, webp)

**Use Case:**
Users on Windows who primarily use the webchat dashboard need to share screenshots for troubleshooting, share documents, or provide visual context to their AI assistant.

**Workaround:**
Currently using Telegram for image sharing, but would prefer to stay in the webchat interface.

**Environment:**
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Windows 11 (user), Ubuntu 24.04 (gateway)
- Browser: Chrome/Edge

Thank you!
