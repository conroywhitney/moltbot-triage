## Description

## Summary

`openclaw doctor` exits with code 1 and produces zero output — no stdout, no stderr. This makes it impossible to diagnose configuration issues or verify system health after an upgrade.

## Steps to Reproduce

```powershell
openclaw doctor
# Exit code: 1
# stdout: (empty)
# stderr: (empty)
```

Also tested:
```powershell
openclaw doctor --fix
# Same result: exit 1, no output
```

## Expected Behavior

Doctor should output diagnostic results — checks performed, warnings found, fixes applied — and exit with code 0 if healthy or a meaningful error if not.

## Actual Behavior

Complete silence. No indication of what was checked, what failed, or what needs attention.

## Impact

- Cannot verify system health after upgrade
- Cannot use in automated post-upgrade scripts
- Agents relying on doctor output for diagnostics get nothing to work with

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.1.30, Windows 10
- Run from PowerShell (both regular and admin)
- Node.js v24.13.0
- Note: `openclaw --version` works correctly, so the CLI is functional
