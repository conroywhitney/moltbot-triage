## Description

## Summary
I have observed a significant discrepancy in behavior when running the agent natively on Windows (via PowerShell) versus running it in WSL (Ubuntu) on the same machine.

When running in PowerShell, the agent loses the ability to proactively contact me. It never sends follow-up messages after completing a task, and scheduled tasks (cron jobs) never trigger. However, when running the exact same configuration in WSL, the agent behaves correctly, executing scheduled tasks and sending notifications upon task completion.

## Steps to reproduce
Install the agent on Windows using PowerShell (native environment).

Configure a scheduled task (e.g., a reminder or a periodic check) OR assign a long-running task that requires the agent to report back upon completion.

Wait for the scheduled time or the task to finish.

Compare with WSL: Perform the same steps running the agent inside WSL on the same machine.

## Expected behavior
The agent should execute the scheduled task at the specific time and proactively send a message to the configured channel (e.g., Discord) to notify me when a task is done, identical to its behavior in the WSL environment.

## Actual behavior
In the Windows/PowerShell environment, the agent remains silent.

No proactive contact: It does not send follow-up messages after tasks are ostensibly finished.

Cron jobs fail: Scheduled tasks simply do not fire/trigger at all.


## Environment
OpenClawd version: 2026.1.29 

OS: Windows 10 (Native PowerShell) vs WSL 2 (Ubuntu)

Node Version: v24
