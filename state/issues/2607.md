## Description

## Summary
Hackable install fails on Linux Mint 22.3

## Steps to reproduce
1. install mint as usual
2. run the hackable install one-liner (curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git)
3. clawdbot installs but then fails with "main: line 813: pnpm: command not found"

## Expected behavior
That pnpm would run the next part of the installation process.

## Actual behavior
I believe that pnpm was supposed to be executed, but the installer script is unable to find where it installed it

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: from git
- OS: Linux Mint 22.3
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): "Hackable" shell one-liner
