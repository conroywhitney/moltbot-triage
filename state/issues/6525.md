## Description

**Describe the bug**
When dragging and dropping an image file from the desktop into the OpenClaw web UI chat input, the browser opens the file in a new tab instead of uploading it as media.

**Expected behavior**
The image should be uploaded and sent as a message attachment.

**To Reproduce**
1. Open OpenClaw web UI (webchat)
2. Drag an image file from desktop onto the chat input area
3. Browser opens the image in a new tab instead of uploading

**Environment**
- Channel: webchat

**Workaround**
- Copy image → Paste works
- Using file picker works (if available)

**Additional context**
Error 1009 also appears when trying to paste images, which may be related to client-side media handling in the web UI.
