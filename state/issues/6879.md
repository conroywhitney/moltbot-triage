## Description

Title

@openclaw/nostr npm package fails to install due to unresolved workspace:* dependencies

Description

Installing the published npm package @openclaw/nostr fails when installed standalone (outside the OpenClaw monorepo).

The published tarball contains dependencies specified as workspace:*, which npm does not support outside of a workspace context. As a result, npm install fails immediately with EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL.

This appears to be a packaging/publishing issue rather than a runtime or user configuration problem.

Steps to Reproduce
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/nostr
# or manually:
npm install @openclaw/nostr

Actual Behavior

Installation fails with:

Error: Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL

Expected Behavior

The package should install successfully as a standalone npm package, or dependencies should be resolved to concrete versions during publish.

Environment

OS: Linux

Node.js: v22.22.0

npm: 10.9.4

OpenClaw: current stable

References

npm documentation on supported dependency specifiers:
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies

Notes

This installs correctly when using a local monorepo checkout and openclaw plugins install --link, which suggests the package works inside the workspace but is published without resolving workspace:*.

Root vs non-root execution does not affect the failure.

Suggested Fix

Before publishing:

Replace workspace:* with concrete semver versions, or

Bundle internal dependencies, or

Move them to peerDependencies as appropriate.
