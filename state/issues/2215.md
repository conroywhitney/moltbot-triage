## Description

I've observed an issue where the Gemini model is unable to correctly access or modify Clawdbot's CronJobs using the provided tools.

**Symptoms:**
- When instructed to list or modify cron jobs, Gemini often fails or hallucinates the tool interaction, or simply cannot execute the  tool successfully.
- Other models (like Claude Sonnet) handle this correctly.

**Context:**
- Model:  (and likely others in the family)
- Tool:  (list/add/update/remove)
- Environment: Clawdbot runtime

**Expected Behavior:**
Gemini should be able to call the  tool with the correct schema and receive the JSON output, just like other supported models.

**Request:**
Please investigate if there's a schema compatibility issue or a prompt structure problem specifically affecting Gemini's ability to use the  tool.
