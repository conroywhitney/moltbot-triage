## Description

## Description

When the assistant performs tool calls (e.g. shell commands, file reads) without producing any user-facing text content, the TUI displays `(no output)` to the user.

This happens because `tui-formatters.js:resolveFinalAssistantText()` returns `"(no output)"` when both `finalText` and `streamedText` are empty — which is expected for turns that only contain tool calls.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open `clawdbot tui`
2. Ask the assistant something that triggers multiple tool calls before a text response (e.g. debugging/investigating tasks)
3. Each intermediate turn with only tool calls shows `(no output)` in the chat

## Expected Behavior

Tool-only turns should either be hidden entirely or show a subtle indicator (e.g. a spinner or "working...") rather than printing `(no output)` as if it were the assistant's reply.

## Relevant Code

```js
// dist/tui/tui-formatters.js:3-11
export function resolveFinalAssistantText(params) {
    const finalText = params.finalText ?? "";
    if (finalText.trim()) return finalText;
    const streamedText = params.streamedText ?? "";
    if (streamedText.trim()) return streamedText;
    return "(no output)";  // <-- this fires for tool-only turns
}
```
