## Description

## Summary
Node rows in the macOS menubar gateway submenu are clickable, but their behavior is not obvious.

Today, most of these items copy a value to the clipboard, but there is no visible feedback. This makes the menu feel broken.

## Expected Behavior
Clicking an active node item should do one of the following:
1. Show a short in-app toast/overlay confirming the action (for copy actions).
2. Open the relevant settings page when the action is navigational.

## Proposed Direction
- If the action is copy-only, show a toast using the existing in-app overlay (`NotifyOverlayController`).
- If the action is settings/navigation, route the user to the appropriate settings tab.
- Avoid clickable items that appear interactive but provide no feedback.

## Scope / Candidates
- Gateway submenu items such as Node ID, Name, IP, Status, Platform, Version, Caps, and Commands.
- Any other menubar nodes/rows that currently copy values silently.

## Notes
This should align with existing UX patterns already used elsewhere in the macOS app:
- In-app overlays via `NotifyOverlayController`
- Explicit navigation via `SettingsWindowOpener` + tab routing
