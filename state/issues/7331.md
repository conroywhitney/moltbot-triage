## Description

**Title:** Zombie sessions persist in `sessions.json` after completion/manual removal

**Description:**
I encountered an issue where a sub-agent session (`sessions_spawn`) completed its task but remained listed as active in `openclaw sessions list` indefinitely.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Spawn a sub-agent session.
2. Allow session to complete successfully.
3. The session remains in `openclaw sessions list --json` output.
4. Manually deleting the transcript (`.jsonl`) results in the session still being listed, but now with missing data.
5. Restarting the gateway (`openclaw gateway restart`) **does not** clean up these entries.

**Expected behavior:**

- Completed one-off sessions should be automatically removed from the index.
- Alternatively, `openclaw sessions list` should perform a sanity check and prune entries from `sessions.json` if the corresponding transcript file is missing.
- Gateway restart should perform a cleanup of the session index.

**Workaround:**
Manually editing `.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json` to remove the stale entry was required to fix the state.

**Context:**
- OpenClaw Version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Linux
