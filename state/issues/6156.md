## Description

Title:
macOS Gateway never becomes ready (Setup Wizard stuck on Retry)

Environment:
- macOS: (例: macOS 15.x / Apple Silicon)
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30 (brew cask)
- Install method: Homebrew (brew install openclaw)

What happened:
- Setup Wizard shows "Gateway did not become ready. Check that it is running."
- Clicking Retry loops forever.
- Gateway process is running (confirmed with ps).
- Running gateway manually opens the app but Wizard never detects readiness.

What I tried:
- This Mac selected from start
- gateway start / --foreground / --log-level debug
- Accessibility + Local Network permissions enabled
- Rebooted macOS
- No errors shown in terminal

Expected:
- Wizard detects running gateway and proceeds.

Notes:
- Possibly IPC / localhost / readiness check bug on macOS.

## Comments

Additional info:
- Reproduced consistently after multiple retries.
- Gateway process is running (confirmed via ps).
- No output even with --log-level debug.

### @infostorymaker0917-stack (2026-02-01)

Additional issue:

I accidentally chose "Configure later" during the initial setup.
After that, I cannot find any way to re-run the setup or select "This Mac (Local)" again.

There is:
- no Settings menu
- no menu bar item
- no option to reconfigure from the app UI

Restarting the app or the Mac does not help.
This makes the setup state irreversible once "Configure later" is selected.

This seems like a UX / setup flow bug.
There should be a way to re-run initial setup or reset configuration.
