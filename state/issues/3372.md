## Description

 Title: TUI: Backspace deletes two characters instead of one                                        
                                                                                                    
 Environment:

 Description:                                                                                       
 When typing in the TUI input field (clawdbot tui), pressing backspace deletes two characters       
 instead of one. The issue is consistent and happens every time.                                    
                                                                                                    
 Steps to reproduce:                                                                                
 1. Run clawdbot tui                                                                                
 2. Type some text (e.g., "hello world")                                                            
 3. Press backspace once                                                                            
 4. Observe that two characters are deleted                                                         
                                                                                                    
 Notes:                                                                                             
 - Does NOT occur in Telegram channel                                                               
 - Does NOT occur in other terminal applications                                                    
 - Terminals themselves work correctly with backspace elsewhere
