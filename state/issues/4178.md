## Description

# Discord: Add config option to control typing indicator behavior

## Problem

Currently, the Discord plugin shows a typing indicator as soon as it begins processing a message, before the agent decides whether to reply. This creates a poor UX in group chats where the agent frequently stays silent (NO_REPLY):

1. User sends a message
2. Discord shows "Aris is typing..."
3. Agent decides to stay silent (HEARTBEAT_OK or NO_REPLY)
4. No message appears, but typing was shown

This creates confusion and makes the agent seem unresponsive.

## Proposed Solution

Add a Discord config option to control when typing indicators are shown:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "typingMode": "on-reply" // or "always" (default), "never"
    }
  }
}
```

**Options:**
- `always` (current behavior): Show typing as soon as processing starts
- `on-reply`: Only show typing after the agent decides to send a reply
- `never`: Never show typing indicators

## Alternative Names

- `showTyping`: boolean or enum
- `typingOnReplyOnly`: boolean
- `typingIndicator`: enum

## Context

This is especially important for agents in group chats following the "stay quiet by default" pattern outlined in AGENTS.md, where the agent monitors conversations but only speaks when genuinely needed.

Related: `agents.defaults.typingMode` already exists but controls *periodic* typing during long responses, not the initial trigger.

## Workaround (Current)

Setting `agents.defaults.typingMode: "never"` prevents periodic typing during responses but doesn't stop the initial typing indicator.
