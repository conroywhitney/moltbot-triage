## Description

## Summary
Install failed due to broken / missing libsignal dependency

## Steps to reproduce
1.  Followed one-line install from OpenClaw, npm failed
2. Attempted npm install -g openclaw@latest --> same issue
3. Attempted npm install -g openclaw@2026.1.28 --> same result
4.  Debuged and Claude (not Clawd), identified the libsignal dependency 


## Expected behavior
Successful install

## Actual behavior
Install failed

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.01.28 and 01.29
- OS: macOS with Node.js v22.17.1 and npm 10.9.2
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): per above

## Logs or screenshots
The exact error: No matching version found for libsignal@whiskeysockets-libsignal-node-master.tar.gz-art-external
Your system: macOS with Node.js v22.17.1 and npm 10.9.2
That it fails on both version 2026.1.29 and 2026.1.28

The libsignal connection:
OpenClaw uses Baileys (from WhiskeySockets) for its WhatsApp integration. Baileys is a WhatsApp Web protocol implementation that depends on libsignal-node for encryption. Your error message shows that the npm package is looking for:
libsignal@whiskeysockets-libsignal-node-master.tar.gz-art-external
This appears to be a malformed or broken dependency reference. The weird master.tar.gz-art-external part suggests someone may have incorrectly specified a GitHub tarball URL as a version string in the package.json.
What's likely happening:
This is almost certainly a packaging error in the latest OpenClaw releases (2026.1.29 and 2026.1.28). The dependency tree for WhatsApp support (via Baileys) isn't resolving correctly.
