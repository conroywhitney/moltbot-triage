## Description

Hi, 

I've been using DeepSeek with the custom provider setting and it works great, but I think it would be a good idea to add it as a native/built-in provider. It's getting really popular and having it built-in would make the configuration much easier for everyone. 

I'm happy to help with testing or anything else needed to get this in. 

Thanks!

Indeed, it should be supported, mainly because its price is very economical and the effect is also quite good. As a built-in provider, it can not only enhance user experience but also lower the usage barrier, encouraging more users to adopt it. Looking forward to the official considering this suggestion and implementing it as soon as possible.
