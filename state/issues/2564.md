## Description

## Summary
We have built an input compression tool that sits between input and LLM and compresses out least significant tokens that won't affect the LLM output. This middleware is able to save 19-66% on LLM inference based on the use case and input type (natural language works the best!)

## Proposed solution
Allow users to opt into input compression to save on token costs.

## Additional context
Compression model we offer is available at thetokencompany.com
