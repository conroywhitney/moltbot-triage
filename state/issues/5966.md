## Description

## Description

The `render.yaml` Blueprint specifies `plan: starter`, but the OpenClaw gateway requires more than 512MB RAM to start. The Node.js process consistently OOMs during gateway initialization.

## Evidence

Tested on Render Starter plan (512MB):

1. **V8 heap OOM at default (250MB)**: `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed`
2. **V8 heap OOM at 384MB**: Same heap OOM, peak usage ~375MB
3. **Container OOM at 450MB heap**: V8 survived but Render killed the container: `==> Out of memory (used over 512Mi)`

The gateway needs ~450MB for V8 heap + ~80-100MB for V8 internals/Node.js runtime/OS = ~530-550MB total, exceeding the 512MB Starter plan.

## Fix

Update `render.yaml` to use `plan: standard` (2GB RAM):

```diff
services:
  - type: web
    name: openclaw
    runtime: docker
-   plan: starter
+   plan: standard
```

## Additional issues found in render.yaml

1. **Missing `gateway` subcommand**: The Dockerfile `CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]` runs without the `gateway` subcommand, causing the CLI to print help and exit. Needs a `dockerCommand` override or Dockerfile fix (see #5685).

2. **Port mismatch**: The `PORT=8080` env var is set but OpenClaw reads `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, not `PORT`. The gateway defaults to 18789 while Render Docker services route to 10000.

## Working configuration

For reference, this Docker command works on the Standard plan:

```
node dist/index.js gateway --port 10000 --bind lan --allow-unconfigured
```

## Environment

- Render Standard plan (2GB RAM) - working
- Render Starter plan (512MB) - OOM on every attempt
- OpenClaw v2026.1.30 (tag commit 76b5208b)
