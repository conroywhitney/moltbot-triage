## Description

@steipete 
## Environment
- macOS 26.2 (arm64), Mac mini
- Tested on Node 22.22.0 AND Node 25.5.0
- OpenClaw 2026.2.1 (ed4529e)
- sandbox mode: off
- ## Problem
Every exec tool call fails with `spawn EBADF syscall=spawn errno=-9`.
Gateway retries with no-detach, retry also fails.

## Confirmed
- `node -e "require('child_process').execSync('echo hello', {stdio:'inherit'})"` works
- Fails in both LaunchAgent and foreground mode
- Persists after: gateway restart, session reset, Node upgrade, ulimit bump, sandbox off
- read/write/browser/web tools all work — only exec broken
- Log: `spawn failed (spawn EBADF syscall=spawn errno=-9); retrying with no-detach`
