## Description

## Summary

I asked it to define an agent persona, and it added the agent to the agents.list property in .openclaw/openclaw.json, but next to "id", "workspace" and "model" it added a systemPrompt, causing it to become non-responsive.

## Steps to reproduce

It's non-deterministic I'm assuming, but:

1. Something like: "I want to define another agent type. An expert advisor on entrepreneurship, an experienced founder. Run on Opus"

## Expected behavior

Openclaw to keep working.

## Actual behavior

Openclaw became unresponsive; I saw an "invalid config" error. OpenClaw shouldn't break on unknown json fields, probably best if you can't modify the config by changing the file but have to do an explicit reload.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Fedora 41
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npm
