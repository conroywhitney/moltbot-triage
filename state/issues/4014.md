## Description

## Problem

The webchat Control UI disconnects frequently with `code=1008 reason=slow consumer` when the client can't drain messages fast enough. This happens even on stable 30ms latency connections over Tailscale.

## Logs

```
webchat disconnected code=1008 reason=slow consumer conn=...
```

Disconnects occur every 1-1.5 seconds, causing event gaps and requiring constant reconnects.

## Request

Add a configurable threshold for slow consumer detection, e.g.:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "controlUi": {
      "slowConsumerTimeoutMs": 5000,
      "slowConsumerBufferSize": 100
    }
  }
}
```

Or increase the default threshold — the current one seems too aggressive for real-world network conditions.

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Server: Ubuntu on Tailscale 
- Client: macOS Firefox over Tailscale
- Latency: ~30ms, 0% packet loss
