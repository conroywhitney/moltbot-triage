## Description

## Description

When a cross-context message is sent (e.g., from a BlueBubbles/iMessage session to Discord), the gateway dashboard's session label (top-right dropdown) updates to show the last channel user identifier rather than the actual session owner.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a main session active (e.g., `agent:main:main`) connected via Discord
2. Receive a message from a different channel (e.g., an iMessage user via BlueBubbles)
3. The message routes to the main session correctly
4. The dashboard session label in the top-right changes to show the BlueBubbles user's phone number instead of the session owner's Discord identity

## Expected Behavior

The session label should consistently show the session owner/name (e.g., `main` or the owner's identifier), not the last inbound channel user.

## Actual Behavior

The label switches to the last channel user who sent a message into the session (e.g., `user:+1XXXXXXXXXX` instead of the session owner).

## Impact

Cosmetic/UX only — message routing works correctly. But it's confusing when multiple channel users feed into the same session.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channels: Discord + BlueBubbles (iMessage)
- Cross-context messaging enabled
