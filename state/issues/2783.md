## Description

## Summary
Add `role-create` action to the Discord message tool, similar to existing `channel-create` and `category-create`.

## Use Case
When automating Discord project setup, we need to:
1. Create a channel ✅ (`channel-create` exists)
2. Create a category ✅ (`category-create` exists)
3. Create a role ❌ (**missing**)
4. Assign role to users ✅ (`role-add` exists)

Currently, roles must be created manually, breaking the automation flow.

## Proposed API
```json
{
  "action": "role-create",
  "name": "project-name",
  "guildId": "GUILD_ID",
  "color": "#FF5733",  // optional
  "mentionable": true   // optional
}
```

## Context
Spec: `specs/discord-management-skill.md`
Related: Building a Discord Management Skill to automate project channel setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `role-create` action creates a new role in the guild
- [ ] Returns the created role ID
- [ ] Handles "role already exists" gracefully (return existing ID or error)
- [ ] Optional parameters: color, mentionable, hoist
