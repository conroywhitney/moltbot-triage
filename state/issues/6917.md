## Description

## Description

Replies generated immediately after a `config.patch` (or `config.apply`) restart may not be delivered to the original channel (e.g., iMessage). The reply appears in Control UI (WebSocket reconnects quickly) but is silently dropped for channels with more startup latency.

## Reproduction

1. Send a message via iMessage
2. Agent calls `config.patch` which triggers a restart
3. After restart, agent sends a reply
4. Reply appears in Control UI but not in iMessage

## Expected Behavior

Either:
- Gateway should queue outbound messages until channels confirm they're ready
- Or at minimum, log a warning when delivery fails due to channel not ready

## Observed Behavior

- No delivery log for the message
- No error or warning logged
- Message silently lost on iMessage, visible only in Control UI

## Logs
