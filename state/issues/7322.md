## Description

## Summary

I would like to use the new Step 3.5 model that was released under a free endpoint on Openrouter last night (openrouter/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free) as it sees quite powerful (and free).

## Proposed solution

I would like for the openrouter provider implementation to support the above mentioned model endpoint.

## Alternatives considered

I've tried simply adding the slug to the models section of the openclaw.json config file, but it just returns the following error rather than generating text:
```
 Agent failed before reply: Unknown model: openrouter/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free.
Logs: openclaw logs --follow
```

I wouldn't mind making this change myself it were more clear to me where the change should be made.

After running the `openclaw models scan` tool, I now see that is marked as 'fail' under the Tool column, but the openrouter does indicate that it supports tool calling (Claude Code is the most used app), I'm not sure where to see it on the model page but Supports Tools is displayed on the comparison view: [https://openrouter.ai/compare/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free](https://openrouter.ai/compare/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free).
