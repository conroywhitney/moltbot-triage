## Description

## Bug Description

The `message` tool lowercases Signal group IDs before passing them to signal-cli. Since Base64 is case-sensitive, this corrupts the group ID and causes "Group not found" errors.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a Signal group with a Base64 group ID containing uppercase letters (e.g., `VpVD1Z7py+k6DSC+oxEcDey5sndViJyJ9Ogi0kvgiLY=`)
2. Try to send a message using the `message` tool:
   ```
   message send --channel signal --target "group:VpVD1Z7py+k6DSC+oxEcDey5sndViJyJ9Ogi0kvgiLY=" --message "test"
   ```
3. Observe the error: `Signal RPC -1: Group not found: vpvd1z7py+k6dsc+oxecdey5sndvijyj9ogi0kvgilw=`

## Expected Behavior

The group ID should be passed to signal-cli with its original case preserved.

## Actual Behavior

The group ID is lowercased somewhere in the pipeline:
- Original: `VpVD1Z7py+k6DSC+oxEcDey5sndViJyJ9Ogi0kvgiLY=`
- After lowercasing: `vpvd1z7py+k6dsc+oxecdey5sndvijyj9ogi0kvgilw=` (invalid Base64)

The lowercased string doesn't even decode to valid Base64, as the padding changes meaning.

## Workaround

Using `sessions_send` to an existing Signal group session works, because the session's `deliveryContext.to` preserves the correct case.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: latest (npm)
- signal-cli: running as daemon
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)

## Additional Context

The group exists in signal-cli's database (verified via sqlite3 query of `~/.local/share/signal-cli/data/*/account.db`). The issue is purely in how the group ID is handled before being passed to the RPC call.
