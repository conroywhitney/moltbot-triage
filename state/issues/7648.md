## Description

## Problem

When the agent responds to a message in the Control UI or WebChat, the view auto-scrolls to the bottom of the response. For longer responses, users have to scroll back up to read from the beginning.

## Requested Feature

Add a configuration option or UI toggle to:
1. **Disable auto-scroll** — Keep the view at the top of the response when it arrives
2. Or add a **"Scroll to Top" button** — Quick way to jump to the beginning of a long response

## Use Case

When reviewing long agent responses (code, documentation, analysis), users want to read from the top down, not be dropped at the bottom.

## Suggested Implementation

Option A: Config flag
```json5
{
  gateway: {
    controlUi: {
      autoScroll: false  // or "top" | "bottom" | "off"
    }
  }
}
