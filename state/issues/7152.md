## Description

Context (OpenClaw user):

We have automations that try to read ~/.openclaw/restart-sentinel.json to detect recent gateway restarts. In some deployments the file is missing, causing repeated scary log lines like:

`read failed: ENOENT: no such file or directory, access '/Users/.../.openclaw/restart-sentinel.json'`

Expected behavior:
- restart sentinel should be treated as optional context, not required
- ideally provide a stable API to query last restart event, or guarantee sentinel persistence
- and/or downgrade missing sentinel to debug-level (not an error)

Notes:
- Docs mention config.apply/config.patch write a restart sentinel, but it is not guaranteed to exist forever.
- The noise comes from tools/automations doing a file read and surfacing ENOENT.

Request:
- Clarify intended lifecycle of restart-sentinel.json
- If it can be absent, consider changing behavior so missing sentinel does not emit error-level logs (or provide a safe read helper).

FYI: created upstream tracker for restart-sentinel noise earlier; unrelated.
