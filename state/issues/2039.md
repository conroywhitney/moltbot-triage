## Description

## Request
Add native support for POE API as a model provider.

## Why
- POE subscribers can't use their API credits in Clawdbot
- POE has OpenAI-compatible API (since July 2025)
- Would enable access to Claude, GPT-5, Mistral, Llama, etc.
- Similar to existing OpenRouter/GitHub Copilot support

## Comments

willing to

I believe this *may* be possible already via a custom model provider in the configs, but there would be issues with tool calling support at least. Definitely would love to see this added as a first-class provider
