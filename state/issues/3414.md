## Description

## Problem

To edit a session label, you have to go to the Sessions tab and find the session there.

## Expected

Ability to edit the session label directly in the Chat tab.

## Proposed solution

Add a label input field in the Chat tab header (near the session selector) that allows editing the current session's label.

## Environment

- Moltbot Web UI (Control Panel)
