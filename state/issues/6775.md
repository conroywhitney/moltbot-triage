## Description

## Bug Description
iMessage messages are not delivered in real-time to the agent. Messages arrive at the Messages app but the agent does not receive real-time notifications/push events.

## Environment
- **OS**: macOS 25.2.0 (arm64)
- **OpenClaw version**: 2026.1.30 (just updated from 2026.1.29)
- **Node version**: v25.5.0
- **iMessage CLI**: imsg v0.4.0

## Expected Behavior
When a user sends an iMessage to the agent, the agent should receive a real-time notification and can respond immediately without manual intervention.

## Actual Behavior
1. User sends iMessage to agent
2. Message is stored in Messages database
3. Agent does NOT receive real-time event/push
4. Agent can only see the message by manually running `imsg history` command
5. The message shows in `imsg history` with correct timestamps, confirming delivery to database

## Reproduction Steps
1. Start OpenClaw gateway (`openclaw gateway`)
2. Send iMessage to the agent's phone number (+642885325995)
3. Wait for response - agent does not respond in real-time
4. Agent must manually execute `imsg history --chat-id <id> --limit 3` to see the message

## Additional Info
- `imsg watch` command exists and can stream incoming messages, but this requires a background process
- The Gateway should be handling real-time message delivery from imsg
- Direct message sending FROM agent works fine (agent can send iMessages)
- Group chat messages also affected

## Workaround
Manual polling via `imsg history` is the only way to see incoming messages.

## Severity
Medium - Affects agent responsiveness to incoming iMessages, but cron tasks (weather briefing, X news, etc.) still work fine.
