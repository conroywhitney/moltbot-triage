## Description

## Summary
Many users want to configure a local Ollama server from the start with a local model. In the onboarding processess it would be nice to simply provide a configuration for ollama on a local host or an on net ip address. 

## Proposed solution
When a user onboards moltbot they would have an option of configuring common local ollama servers. 


## Additional context
This is the menu that it would be nice to have it on.
