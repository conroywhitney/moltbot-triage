## Description

## Problem
When a sub-agent hits `runTimeoutSeconds`, it's killed immediately with no chance to save progress. **All unsaved work is lost** — code, research, analysis, generated content, anything.

## Proposed Solution
Inject a system message to the sub-agent N seconds before the timeout expires:

> ⚠️ You have 60 seconds before timeout. Save your progress NOW — write results to files and finish.

This gives the agent a chance to checkpoint **any** kind of work before being killed:
- Code changes (commit or write to file)
- Research notes and analysis
- Generated content (articles, reports)
- Task board updates
- Memory writes
- Any accumulated state

## Suggested Config
```yaml
sessions:
  subAgentGracePeriodSeconds: 60  # warning injected before kill
```

## Current Workaround
Include in every sub-agent prompt: *"After completing EACH step, immediately write progress to a checkpoint file."* — but this is fragile, wastes tokens on repeated writes, and easy to forget.

## Use Case
Any long-running sub-agent task: multi-step code fixes, deep research, content generation, data processing. Agent works for 10 minutes, gets killed by timeout, no record of progress.
