## Description

I am unable to authenticate with the Moltbot web dashboard. The container runs successfully, but the UI consistently shows a disconnected state, even when using the correct token provided in the URL or entered manually via settings.

**Environment/System Information**

- OS: Windows 10/11
- Docker Image: `moltbot/moltbot:latest`
- Browsers Tested: Chrome/Brave (standard/incognito), Firefox (standard/incognito)
- Gateway Token Used: `ankur@1202`
- OpenAI Key: Configured and confirmed via CLI setup.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Run the container using the following command (with actual keys redacted for security):
```
docker run -d ^
  --name moltbot ^
  -p 18789:18789 ^
  -v moltbot-data:/home/node/.moltbot ^
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="<my-openai-key>" ^
  -e CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN="ankur@1202" ^
  moltbot/moltbot:latest
```

2. Navigate to the URL in a fresh browser tab/incognito window:
`http://localhost:18789/?token=ankur@1202`

**Expected Behavior**
The dashboard should authenticate automatically, show "Health Online", and allow interaction in the chat window.

**Actual Behavior**
The UI remains disconnected. A persistent error is displayed: disconnected (1008): pairing required
The backend Docker logs show the following recurring error every time the browser attempts a connection:
`[ws] unauthorized conn=... client=moltbot-control-ui ... reason=unauthorized: gateway token missing`

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken (All failed)**
Confirmed the `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly inside the container via docker inspect:
```
PS C:\Users\hp> docker inspect moltbot | Select-String "CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN"
                "CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN=ankur@1202",
```

- Tried accessing the link in Chrome (standard and incognito), Brave (standard and incognito), and Firefox (standard and incognito).
- Tried manually typing the token `ankur@1202` into the "Settings" panel within the UI.
- Temporarily disabled the Windows Defender Firewall entirely.

It appears the web UI client is failing to correctly read/send the token back to the gateway server.

did you try to pair it? for what i recall even with the token you still need to pair....

Yes, I tried to pair it using the token in the URL (http://localhost:18789/?token=ankur@1202) and manually entering it in the settings, but it still says 'disconnected (1008): pairing required'. The docker inspect command confirms the token is correct in the environment variable. It might be a bug with the current version.

ok, did you try if there is any device pending approval?  "openclaw devices list" ... check if there is a pending request id... then you "openclaw devices approve ID" . since you are using docker and "moltbot", you can try to enter in container and and do the moltbot devices list and approve... i had same issue and just reproduce in a new browser... even with token validation it asks for id approval...

something like this:

You need to create an config json file in docker, https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/6959
