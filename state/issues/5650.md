## Description

## Description

The OpenClaw logo image is not loading in the Gateway Dashboard. Instead of the logo, a broken image placeholder is displayed next to the "OPENCLAW" text.

## Screenshot

<img width="360" height="91" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70f0ffa2-6b6f-47ce-8f54-3f36446e70c0" />

## Expected Behavior

The OpenClaw logo should display correctly in the Gateway Dashboard header.

## Actual Behavior

A broken image icon appears instead of the logo.

## Additional Context

This appears to be in the Gateway Dashboard interface where it shows "OPENCLAW" / "OpenClaw" / "GATEWAY DASHBOARD".
