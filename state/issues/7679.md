## Description

## Summary

The current default `dmPolicy: pairing` for Telegram allows anyone to message the bot and request access via a pairing code. This creates a security concern where random users could potentially get paired if someone approves them accidentally.

## Suggested Change

Default to `dmPolicy: allowlist` with the owner's Telegram ID auto-captured during onboarding.

The setup wizard already asks you to message the bot to complete pairing — it could capture that user's ID right there and:
1. Set `dmPolicy: allowlist`
2. Add the owner's Telegram ID to `allowFrom`

This would be a safer default while still being easy to configure for multi-user setups.

## Current Behavior

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "dmPolicy": "pairing"
    }
  }
}
```

## Proposed Behavior

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["<owner-telegram-id>"]
    }
  }
}
```
