## Description

## Summary
I’d like to add an optional cognee memory provider to Moltbot for users who want semantic memory powered by knowledge graphs backed by embeddings instead of, or alongside, the default SQLite vector memory. This would be opt‑in and not change defaults. Cognee is open source and can be ran fully locally.

## Proposed solution
Introduce Cognee as a memorySearch.provider option. 

I already drafted a PR but if the approach is acceptable, happy to split into smaller pieces
https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/pull/4202

- A Cognee client + provider implementation behind the existing memory search interface
- Config/schema support for Cognee settings 
- Minimal docs + example config/compose for local setup
- Lightweight tests focused on provider result shaping

## Alternatives considered
Rely solely on the existing SQLite memory

## Additional context
