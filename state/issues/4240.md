## Description

## Summary

Moltbot should natively support connecting to remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, similar to how Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Claude Code do.

## Current State

- Moltbot does not have a native MCP client
- Workaround via `mcporter` CLI exists (skill), but:
  - Requires separate installation
  - OAuth flows need a browser → blocked on headless servers
  - Token management is manual

## Proposed Solution

Add native MCP client support to Moltbot with:

1. **Config section** for MCP servers:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "miro": {
        "url": "https://mcp.miro.com/",
        "auth": "oauth"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **OAuth support** with:
   - Device flow for headless servers (display code, user authorizes on their device)
   - Token injection for pre-existing tokens
   - Auto-refresh

3. **Tool exposure**: MCP tools appear as native Moltbot tools callable by the agent

## Use Case

User wants to use Miro MCP from a headless Moltbot server:
- Currently: blocked (OAuth needs browser)
- With this feature: device flow or token injection works

## References

- [MCP Specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification)
- [Miro MCP Server](https://mcp.miro.com/)
- [mcporter](https://github.com/steipete/mcporter) - existing CLI workaround

## Context

Discovered while trying to integrate Miro MCP with Moltbot on a headless server. The agent (Claude) behind Moltbot should be able to use MCP tools just like Claude Desktop can.

## Comments

### @biaji (2026-01-30)

Mcporter implement looks buggly while model is not power enough:

I can see it marked as ready in ```openclaw skills list```

But it's never functional. Even I use ```/skills list``` in chat box, it's not listed as expected.
