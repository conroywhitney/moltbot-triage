## Description

## Problem

Currently, sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents (documented in `tools/subagents.md`). This creates a flat hub-and-spoke architecture where only the main agent can orchestrate work.

## Use Case

We run an organizational structure with C-Level agents (CTO, COO, CISO) that should be able to manage their own teams of specialized agents:

```
Main Agent (Chief of Staff)
  ├── CTO Agent → spawns DevOps, Research, Infra agents
  ├── COO Agent → spawns Comms, Ops agents
  └── CISO Agent → spawns Audit, Security agents
```

Without nested spawning, the main agent becomes a bottleneck — every task must be directly orchestrated by it, limiting true parallelism and delegation depth.

## Current Workaround

We spawn all agents flat from the main agent with different `agentId` targets. This works but:
- Main agent context window fills up managing all results
- No true delegation — main agent must track every sub-task
- Limited organizational structure

## Proposed Solution

Allow configurable depth for sub-agent spawning:

```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    subagents:
      maxDepth: 2  # Allow sub-agents to spawn 1 level deeper
      maxConcurrent: 24
```

With safeguards:
- `maxDepth` controls how many levels deep spawning can go (default: 1 = current behavior)
- Each level inherits the parent's `maxConcurrent` limit
- Total concurrent agents across all levels capped by a global limit
- Results bubble up through the chain

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Hardware: Apple M1 Max, 32GB RAM (can handle many more concurrent agents)
- Current config: maxConcurrent 6, maxConcurrentSubagents 12

## Impact

This would enable:
- True hierarchical delegation
- Better context window management (each level manages its own scope)
- More natural organizational structures
- Exponential scaling of parallel work

Thank you for the amazing tool! 🙏
