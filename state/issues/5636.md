## Description

## Description

When a skill exists in both the user's workspace (`~/clawd/skills/`) and the bundled OpenClaw skills (`/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/`), both copies get registered as Discord slash commands. The second one gets a `_2` suffix.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a skill (e.g., `bird`, `peekaboo`, `summarize`) in both:
   - `~/clawd/skills/<skill>/`
   - `<openclaw-install>/skills/<skill>/`
2. Start OpenClaw with Discord enabled and `commands.native: "auto"`
3. Check Discord slash commands — you'll see both `/skill_name` and `/skill_name_2`

## Expected Behavior

OpenClaw should dedupe skills by name before registering slash commands. If a skill exists in both locations, prefer the workspace version (or make this configurable).

## Actual Behavior

Both copies are registered, with the second getting a `_2` suffix. This clutters the slash command list.

## Workaround

Manually delete the `_2` commands via Discord API after each restart.

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.1.30
- macOS
- Discord channel enabled
