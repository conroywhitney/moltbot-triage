## Description

## Issue

Tool streaming does not work in webchat. Terminal output is only shown after command completes, not in real-time.

## Expected Behavior

When running `exec` commands, output should stream in real-time as the command produces it.

## Actual Behavior

- Backend: `spawn` is used, `emitUpdate()` is called
- Framework: `tool_execution_update` events are produced
- Frontend/WebSocket: Only `tool_execution_end` is sent (bulk output)
- Result: User sees output only after completion, not streaming

## Impact

- Long-running commands appear to "freeze" the UI
- Real-time feedback is missing
- User experience is degraded

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- Channel: webchat
- Node version: v22.22.0
- OS: Linux 6.14.0-37-generic (x64)

## Test Cases

Tested with multiple commands:
- Simple loops with sleep
- Long-running processes
- All show bulk output, no streaming

## Workaround

Background exec + process log pattern:
```javascript
exec(command, background: true)
process log(sessionId)
```

This provides real-time output but requires manual work.

## Additional Notes

- Backend analysis confirmed spawn + emitUpdate() is working correctly
- Framework produces tool_execution_update events
- These events are not streamed to frontend via WebSocket
- Only tool_execution_end event is received by frontend
- This appears to be a frontend/websocket implementation issue, not a backend tool issue
