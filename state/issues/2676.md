## Description

I find it pointlessly makes fun of people in Marrakech. Why make them feel bad? I think it is a poor example and also probably makes a lot of people uneasy and leave before taking a good look. I suggest to just remove this quite unfunny "example usage" and replace it by something neutral.

Much agree; immediately got turned away by the gross prejudices in WhatsApp screenshot in the repo's README. Please consider finding another example dialog to share. Thank you.

I will never use a tool which displays this kind of "jokes" in its documentation.

### @friggingee (2026-01-27)

This is not an "oopsie".
This is a deliberate decision to include racist stereotypes into the readme.
There is absolutely no reason to have such a "dialogue" in the screenshot.
It serves no purpose for the software, it showcases no relevant use case.

It only shows that the creator of that screenshot felt the need to publish a racist fake chat.

Completely needlessly added in this commit: a27ee2366ebfa366ee960e567f72f97fe63085d9

Support this. We should replace the screenshot with a neutral technical use case to keep the focus on the tool's functionality. There are already plenty of great real-world examples and use cases shared on X regarding how to use moltbot/clowdbot that would serve as much better documentation.

### @timseverien (2026-01-29)

I was about to write an issue for this. At this point, it only demonstrates that Moltbot can chat back and affirm nasty, racist, prejudices. Let's be better than this.

+1

Before getting interested in artificial intelligence, be sure to have some natural one.
