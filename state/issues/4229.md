## Description

## Summary

I'd like to propose adding a Plivo SMS/MMS channel extension to enable phone-based access to Clawdbot. This was previously submitted as PR #2482, which was closed for being too large without prior alignment. I'm opening this issue to discuss the approach before resubmitting.

## Motivation

SMS provides a universally accessible interface that works on any phone without requiring app installation or internet connectivity beyond basic cellular service.

## Proposed Features

- **SMS Channel Adapter**: Two-way SMS messaging via Plivo API
- **MMS Support**: Send/receive images, videos, and documents
- **Quick Commands**: Shortcuts like `cal`, `todo`, `weather` that expand to full commands (useful given SMS character limits)
- **Auto-webhook Configuration**: Webhooks configured automatically on startup (no manual Plivo console setup)

## Proposed Configuration

```yaml
channels:
  sms:
    provider: plivo
    phoneNumber: "+14155551234"
    webhookUrl: "https://your-clawdbot.example.com"
    dmPolicy: "allowlist"  # pairing | allowlist | open | disabled
    allowFrom:
      - "+15550001111"
      - "+15550002222"
    plivo:
      authId: "YOUR_PLIVO_AUTH_ID"
      authToken: "YOUR_PLIVO_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

## Suggested PR Breakdown

| PR | Scope |
|----|-------|
| 1 | Core SMS adapter (send/receive, config, provider interface, tests) |
| 2 | MMS media attachment support |
| 3 | Auto-webhook configuration on startup |
| 4 | Quick command shortcuts |

## Questions for Maintainers

1. Does this approach work for you?
2. Is the proposed PR breakdown reasonable?
