## Description

  ## Problem

  Running `./scripts/package-mac-dist.sh` fails with:

  error: 'macos': unknown package 'MoltbotKit' in dependencies of target 'Moltbot'; valid packages are: ... 'ClawdbotKit' (at '.../apps/shared/ClawdbotKit')

  ## Cause

  During the Clawd → Molt rename, the `apps/macos/Package.swift` was updated to reference `package: "MoltbotKit"`, but SPM identifies local packages by their directory name, not the `name` field in Package.swift.

  The shared package lives at `apps/shared/ClawdbotKit/` so SPM sees it as `ClawdbotKit`, not `MoltbotKit`.

  ## Fix

  Change all `package: "MoltbotKit"` references to `package: "ClawdbotKit"` in `apps/macos/Package.swift`.

I blame Anthropic and their greedy talons.

### @lofimichael (2026-01-27)

imo stability should be the top priority with moltbot - this sort of rush is understandable with all the hype and usage, compounded with legal notice, but not at the cost of stability/security

should builds not be tested before release? https://docs.molt.bot/install/development-channels

it would look worse for anthropic if their actions inadvertently created worse security surface area for a massively tractioned community project

### @freddyhaddad (2026-01-27)

Fixed in #2924 (Tested on M1 Max OS 26)
Please merge
