## Description

 Environment
- Clawdbot v2026.1.24-3
- Linux container (Debian), Node 22
- Tailscale connected

Bug
Adding Telegram accounts, agents.list, and bindings via CLI or RPC writes correctly to config file, but on gateway restart the config is overwritten and these keys are removed.

Steps to Reproduce
1. clawdbot channels add --channel telegram --account friday --token TOKEN
2. clawdbot agents add friday --workspace ~/clawd-friday --bind telegram:friday
3. Verify config has accounts + agents.list (it does)
4. Gateway restarts → accounts, agents.list, bindings gone

 Expected
Multi-agent config persists across restarts
