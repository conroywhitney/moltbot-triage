## Description

## Summary

When using `sessions_send` to send a message to the main session (e.g., from an external app via Gateway API), the response from the AI agent gets echoed back, causing an infinite loop of `NO_REPLY` messages.

## Steps to reproduce

1. External app sends a POST request to Gateway API:
```json
{
  "tool": "sessions_send",
  "args": {
    "sessionKey": "main",
    "message": "[Stickat] Task completed! ..."
  }
}
```
2. Clawdbot receives the message and passes it to the AI agent
3. AI agent responds to the message
4. The response gets echoed back to the AI agent as a new input
5. AI responds with `NO_REPLY`
6. `NO_REPLY` gets echoed back again -> infinite loop

## Expected behavior

The AI's response should be delivered to the appropriate output channel (e.g., Slack DM) without being echoed back as input to the same session.

## Actual behavior

The response is echoed back to the AI agent, causing a loop until manually broken with `REPLY_SKIP`.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)
- Install method: npm
- Channel: Slack

## Logs or screenshots

## Additional context

This might be related to how agent-to-agent communication routes messages. The echo seems to happen specifically when `sessions_send` targets the main session that originated the conversation.
