## Description

The webchat currently shows "You" with a generic red "U" avatar for the user's messages.

**Request:** Add `ui.user.name` and `ui.user.avatar` config options (similar to the existing `ui.assistant` settings). This would allow users to personalize their side of the conversation.

Just adding a vote for this.

I didn't see any rules or guidance for how to reinforce an open ask.
