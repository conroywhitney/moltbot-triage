## Description

## Description
GitHub Copilot provides separate token quotas for Premium and Chat endpoints, but OpenClaw currently only utilizes the Premium quota.

## Problem
- **Premium quota**: Being consumed (87% remaining)
- **Chat quota**: Unused (100% remaining)
- Users cannot access the Chat API endpoint, leaving allocated Chat tokens unutilized

## Requested Feature
Support for GitHub Copilot Chat API endpoint to allow users to:
1. Use Chat API as an alternative or fallback when Premium quota is depleted
2. Maximize token utilization across both quotas
3. Configure which endpoint to use (Premium Completions vs Chat API)

## Current Workaround
None. Users can only use Premium endpoint and must switch to other providers when quota is exhausted.

## Additional Context
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- GitHub Copilot integration: Currently uses Completions API only
- Observed: Premium quota continuing to decrease

## Suggested Implementation
1. Add GitHub Copilot Chat API endpoint support in provider configuration
2. Allow model config to specify which endpoint to use
3. Report both quotas separately in session_status output
