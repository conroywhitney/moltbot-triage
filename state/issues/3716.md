## Description

## Summary
When a fatal error occurs, the Gateway may shut down completely and can only be restarted from a computer. There is currently no option to restart or recover the Gateway directly from Channels, which leads to unnecessary downtime.

## Proposed solution
Implement a watchdog service that monitors the Gateway and automatically restarts it if it crashes. Additionally, add a manual restart option within Channels so users can recover the system without needing access to a computer.

## Alternatives considered
The only current workaround is manually restarting the Gateway from a computer, which is inconvenient and not suitable for production use.

## Additional context
This feature would significantly improve system stability, reliability, and overall user experience.

### @haseeb-heaven (2026-01-29)

I have already created external Python script as watchdog which does the workaround.

But we need to have this option as CLI option

"clawdbot gateway start --watch"

Options like this would be very beneficial.

And Ollama does the same thing for their main services
