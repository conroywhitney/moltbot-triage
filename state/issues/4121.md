## Description

## Summary

The compaction safeguard extension always returns the fallback summary ("Summary unavailable due to context limits") because `ctx.model` is `undefined` when the extension handler is called during compaction.

## Root Cause

In `pi-coding-agent/dist/core/extensions/runner.js`, the `ExtensionRunner` is created with:

```javascript
getModel = () => undefined;  // Default value
```

This is only updated when `initialize()` is called:

```javascript
initialize(actions, contextActions, ...) {
  this.getModel = contextActions.getModel;  // Sets to actual model getter
}
```

However, Clawdbot's `compactEmbeddedPiSessionDirect()` in `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/compact.ts` creates an `AgentSession` via `createAgentSession()` and immediately calls `session.compact()` **without ever calling `extensionRunner.initialize()`**.

As a result, when the safeguard extension checks `ctx.model`:

```typescript
// src/agents/pi-extensions/compaction-safeguard.ts lines 149-159
const model = ctx.model;
if (!model) {
  return {
    compaction: {
      summary: fallbackSummary,  // "Summary unavailable due to context limits"
      firstKeptEntryId: preparation.firstKeptEntryId,
      tokensBefore: preparation.tokensBefore,
      details: { readFiles, modifiedFiles },
    },
  };
}
```

It silently returns the fallback with **no logging**, making it very hard to diagnose.

## Evidence

- Every single compaction in our logs shows "Summary unavailable" — it has **never worked**
- No "Compaction summarization failed" errors in logs (would appear if `summarizeInStages` actually ran and threw)
- Pattern is consistent across all compactions regardless of token count

## Reproduction

Any Clawdbot session using the embedded runner will hit this on compaction.

## Suggested Fix

In `compactEmbeddedPiSessionDirect()`, call `extensionRunner.initialize()` with a minimal implementation that at least provides `getModel`:

```typescript
if (session.extensionRunner) {
  session.extensionRunner.initialize(
    { /* minimal actions */ },
    {
      getModel: () => session.model,
      // ... other required context actions
    },
    { /* minimal command context actions */ }
  );
}
```

Or alternatively, the safeguard extension could fall back to getting the model from the session context directly rather than relying on `ctx.model`.

## Workaround

None currently — compaction summarization is completely broken for embedded runner flows.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- pi-coding-agent: bundled version
- Model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5 (via OAuth)
