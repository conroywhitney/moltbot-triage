## Description

## Description

When updating OpenClaw by re-running the install command (as recommended in docs), the version in the user systemd service file (`~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service`) remains stuck at whatever version was first installed.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install OpenClaw (e.g., `npm install -g openclaw`)
2. Run `openclaw gateway install` to set up the user systemd service
3. Later, update OpenClaw by re-running `npm install -g openclaw`
4. Check the service file - version is still the old one

## Expected Behavior

The service file should reflect the current installed version, or the update process should prompt/remind to regenerate the service file.

## Actual Behavior

The version in the service file stays at the original installation version.

## Environment

- Platform: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Installation: global install
