## Description

## Environment
- **OS**: Arch Linux (kernel 6.18.7-arch1-1)
- **OpenClaw version**: 2026.1.29
- **Node.js version**: v24.13.0
- **Service type**: systemd user service

## Problem

Node host connects successfully on boot, but after approximately 1 minute, the dashboard shows the node as "offline" even though:
- The systemd service is still `active (running)`
- No errors appear in the journal logs

## Reproduction Steps

1. Install node host `openclaw node install`
2. Reboot the machine
3. Observe node connects successfully (shows "connected" in dashboard)
4. Wait ~1 minute
5. Dashboard now shows "offline"
6. restart the node run, and it will back online again.

## Logs

Service status shows running with no errors:
```
● openclaw-node.service - OpenClaw Node Host (v2026.1.29)
     Active: active (running)
```

Journal shows normal startup, no disconnect/reconnect messages:
```
Started OpenClaw Node Host (v2026.1.29).
(node) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated...
node host PATH: /usr/local/bin:...
```

## Comments

### @rucnyz (2026-01-30)

Adding a startup delay works as a workaround.

I added `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 60` to the systemd service file, and the node stays online after boot. 60 seconds delay seems sufficient.

```ini
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 60
ExecStart=...
```

The issue might be related to some network or system component not being fully ready when the service starts, even though `network-online.target` is specified.
