## Description

Messages sent via the WhatsApp channel plugin are displaying visible escape sequences for newlines.

**Example output reported by user:**
```
Moltbot. 😎\n\nAssim (…) aqui.\n\nBom
```

**Expected behavior:**
Actual line breaks should be rendered by WhatsApp.

**Environment:**
- Moltbot (Clawdbot) v2026.1.24-3
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 (LXC)
- Channel: WhatsApp (Gateway)

It seems like double-escaping might be happening in the payload transmission to the WhatsApp connector.
