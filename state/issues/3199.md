## Description

## Description

On certain VPS environments (tested on Hostinger Ubuntu 24.04), the CLI crashes at startup with:

```
SystemError [ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR]: A system error occurred: uv_interface_addresses returned Unknown system error 1
    at Object.networkInterfaces (node:os:217:16)
    at resolvePrimaryIPv4 (file:///.../dist/infra/system-presence.js:15:21)
    at initSelfPresence (file:///.../dist/infra/system-presence.js:35:16)
```

This happens because `os.networkInterfaces()` is called during module initialization without error handling.

## Environment

- Node.js: v22.22.0
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (VPS)
- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3

## Proposed Fix

Wrap the `os.networkInterfaces()` call in a try-catch and fall back to hostname:

```typescript
function resolvePrimaryIPv4(): string | undefined {
  try {
    const nets = os.networkInterfaces();
    // ... existing logic ...
    return pick(prefer) ?? os.hostname();
  } catch {
    return os.hostname();
  }
}
```

## Workaround

The gateway process itself works fine (it starts before CLI calls). Only CLI invocations from subprocesses (like Codex exec) trigger this issue. Using the `cron` tool instead of CLI commands works as a workaround.

## Notes

We tested this fix locally on the affected VPS and it resolves the issue.
