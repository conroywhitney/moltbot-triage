## Description

## Summary
A Clawdbot agent consistently fails to autonomously execute complex workflows (specifically, spawning a sub-agent for web search, content generation, and message delivery) when triggered by a `systemEvent` from a Clawdbot cron job. This leads to a critical failure in delivering scheduled, proactive content without manual user intervention.

## Steps to reproduce
1.  Configure a Clawdbot cron job to trigger a generic `systemEvent` at a specific time (e.g., `clawdbot cron add --system-event "GENERIC_TASK_TRIGGER" --session main`).
    *   Example command pattern: `clawdbot cron add --name "Generic Scheduled Task" --cron "30 10 * * *" --tz "America/Sao_Paulo" --system-event "GENERIC_TASK_TRIGGER" --session main --wake next-heartbeat`
2.  Ensure `HEARTBEAT.md` (or equivalent agent-internal instruction mechanism) contains logic for the agent to spawn a sub-agent upon receiving this `systemEvent` (e.g., "If system event text is 'GENERIC_TASK_TRIGGER', spawn sub-agent with task 'Perform web search, format content, and return to main agent'").
3.  Wait for the cron job to execute and the `systemEvent` to be received by the main agent.
4.  Observe that the agent receives the `systemEvent` (e.g., `System: [TIMESTAMP] GENERIC_TASK_TRIGGER` in conversation history/logs).
5.  Expected: The agent should then autonomously spawn a sub-agent to proceed with the content generation and delivery.
6.  Actual: The agent *fails* to autonomously spawn the sub-agent or take any subsequent action, despite receiving the `systemEvent` and having clear internal instructions/logic.

## Expected behavior
The agent should autonomously and reliably trigger a `sessions_spawn` (and subsequent workflow) upon receiving a `systemEvent` from a configured cron job, without requiring manual intervention from the user. The expectation is 100% autonomous delivery of scheduled content based on system-generated triggers.

## Actual behavior
The agent receives the cron-triggered `systemEvent` but fails to process it to initiate the complex workflow (e.g., `sessions_spawn`). This results in scheduled tasks not being executed autonomously, requiring the user to manually trigger the workflow by sending a specific message.

## Environment
-   Clawdbot version: `2026.1.24-3`
-   OS: `Linux 6.14.0-1018-aws (x64)`
-   Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): `npm -g` for `clawdhub`, standard Clawdbot installation (likely `npm -g` based on context).

## Logs or screenshots

Relevant logs and observed behaviors are embedded in the agent's internal process history, showing the `systemEvent` being received but no subsequent `sessions_spawn` action. Examples of successful `sessions_spawn_response` are available when the workflow is manually triggered by a user message, confirming the sub-agent functionality. The error `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'undici'` was also observed when `clawdhub` failed to function initially, highlighting environmental sensitivities.
