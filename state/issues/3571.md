## Description

## Summary

Currently, Discord messages sent via Clawdbot are limited to plain text + optional media attachments. For structured data like email summaries, task lists, or formatted reports, this results in either ugly markdown tables (rendered as codeblocks) or walls of plain text. Discord's native embeds provide much better visual hierarchy and readability.

## Proposed solution

Add `embeds` parameter to the Discord `sendMessage` action that accepts Discord embed JSON objects per the Discord API spec:

```json
{
  "action": "sendMessage",
  "to": "channel:123",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "Email Check — 21:00",
      "description": "10 emails reviewed",
      "color": 3447003,
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "🗑️ Archive",
          "value": "• Wine About It x4\n• AWS Cost Alert\n• Twitch Sub Expired",
          "inline": true
        },
        {
          "name": "📅 Keep",
          "value": "• Apple Invoice €10.99",
          "inline": true
        }
      ],
      "footer": {
        "text": "Clawdbot • 21:00 UTC"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Alternatives considered

- Plain text with Unicode formatting (bullets + bold) — works but lacks visual polish
- Images with pre-formatted content — heavy and not editable
- Splitting into multiple messages — creates notification noise

## Additional context

Discord API fully supports embeds: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-limits

This would improve readability for email check summaries, task/to-do lists, system notifications, and data reports.
