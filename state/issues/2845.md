## Description

## Description
When the WhatsApp login tool returns a QR code as a base64 PNG image (via \![whatsapp-qr](data:image/png;base64,...)\ markdown), the webchat UI does not render it. The user sees either nothing or broken markdown.

This makes it impossible to complete WhatsApp device linking from the webchat interface, since the QR code cannot be scanned.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open webchat UI
2. Trigger WhatsApp login (e.g. ask agent to set up WhatsApp)
3. Agent calls \whatsapp_login\ action=start
4. Tool returns markdown with embedded base64 PNG image
5. Image is NOT rendered in the webchat UI

## Expected Behavior
The QR code image should render inline in the webchat UI, allowing the user to scan it with their phone.

## Workarounds Attempted
- Sending the QR as a Telegram message (Telegram compresses/degrades it, making it unscannable)
- Attempting to save the base64 to a file and serve it (requires extra steps)

## Environment
- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
- Webchat UI (built-in)
- Browser: Chrome
- OS: Windows 10

## Impact
- **Severity:** Medium — blocks WhatsApp channel setup entirely from webchat
- **Workaround:** Must use alternative method to complete QR scan
- **Affected users:** All Windows/webchat users setting up WhatsApp

## Suggestion
The webchat UI markdown renderer should support inline base64 data URI images (\data:image/png;base64,...\), at minimum for QR codes from the WhatsApp login flow.
