## Description

## Environment
- **OpenClaw version**: 2026.2.1 (latest)
- **Node version**: v22.22.0
- **OS**: macOS 15.5 (arm64)
- **Installation**: Homebrew (`brew install openclaw`)
- **Channel**: Telegram (Bot API via grammY)

## Issue
Telegram bot starts successfully but **does not receive any incoming messages**. The polling loop aborts immediately with `AbortError`.

## Logs
```
2026-02-02T22:12:28.170Z warn [openclaw] Suppressed AbortError: AbortError: This operation was aborted
2026-02-02T22:12:38.686Z warn [openclaw] Suppressed AbortError: AbortError: This operation was aborted
```

Gateway shows:
```
2026-02-02T22:06:18.809Z info gateway/channels/telegram [default] starting provider (@SloanAI_Bot)
2026-02-02T22:06:18.816Z info telegram/network telegram: autoSelectFamily=false (default-node22)
```

But **no subsequent polling activity** - no `getUpdates`, no incoming message logs, nothing.

## Symptoms
- ✅ Outbound messages work (bot can send via `message` tool)
- ✅ Bot API health checks pass (`openclaw status --deep` shows OK)
- ✅ Telegram API `getWebhookInfo` shows no webhook conflict
- ❌ Inbound messages never arrive at OpenClaw
- ❌ `pending_update_count` stays at 0 even after fresh messages sent to bot
- ❌ No polling logs in gateway output

## Configuration
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "botToken": "8227...h8EM",
      "allowFrom": [577...534],
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "groupAllowFrom": [577...534],
      "streamMode": "partial"
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior
Bot should continuously poll `getUpdates` and process incoming messages.

## Actual Behavior
Polling loop aborts immediately on startup. Zero message processing.

## Known Workaround
The documentation mentions:
> "Long-polling aborts immediately on Node 22+ (often with proxies/custom fetch): Node 22+ is stricter about `AbortSignal` instances; foreign signals can abort `fetch` calls right away. Upgrade to a OpenClaw build that normalizes abort signals, or run the gateway on Node 20 until you can upgrade."

However:
- **Node 20 is not compatible** - OpenClaw requires `>=22.0.0`
- **No updated build available** - npm shows latest/beta both at 2026.2.1
- **Users are stuck** - can't downgrade Node, can't upgrade OpenClaw

## Impact
Telegram channel is **completely broken** on the current stable release with Node 22+. This affects:
- All new macOS Homebrew installs (default to Node 22)
- Anyone who upgraded Node recently
- Production bots that can't receive messages

## Request
Please prioritize a fix that normalizes abort signals for Node 22 compatibility, or update the minimum Node requirement in `package.json` if Node 20 is truly required.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Install OpenClaw 2026.2.1 on Node 22.22.0
2. Configure Telegram bot with valid token
3. Start gateway: `openclaw gateway start`
4. Send message to bot from Telegram
5. Observe: no message arrives at OpenClaw, AbortError in logs

## Additional Context
- grammY version: 1.39.3
- @grammyjs/runner version: 2.0.3
- Bot was created fresh via @BotFather
- Privacy mode: disabled (bot should see all group messages)
- No webhook configured (using long-polling)
