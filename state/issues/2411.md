## Description

## Summary

Slack DM threading is not working in Clawdbot. Neither the `replyToMode: "all"` config option nor the `[[reply_to_current]]` tag cause the bot to reply in a thread within DMs.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure Slack with DM threading enabled:
```json
{
  "slack": {
    "dm": {
      "enabled": true,
      "replyToMode": "all"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Send a message to the bot in a Slack DM
3. Observe that the bot's reply does not create/use a thread

Alternatively:
1. Try using the `[[reply_to_current]]` tag in the bot's response
2. Observe that it still doesn't thread the reply

## Expected Behavior

- With `replyToMode: "all"`, bot replies should automatically thread under the triggering message in DMs
- The `[[reply_to_current]]` tag should force threading regardless of config

## Actual Behavior

Bot replies appear as top-level messages in the DM, not as threaded replies. Threading config/tags are silently ignored.

## Environment

- **Clawdbot version**: 2026.1.16-2+ (likely current)
- **OS**: macOS
- **Channel**: Slack (Socket Mode)
- **Context**: Direct Messages (DMs)

## Notes

- Issue #1388 fixed threading for channels with `replyToMode=all`, but DMs still don't work
- Issue #1163 reports the opposite problem (duplicate threading in channels)
- This appears to be specific to DM contexts
