## Description

## Description
When running Clawdbot CLI commands in Dokploy's web terminal, **all styled boxes** have invisible content. The box borders render correctly (colored), but the text inside appears to be black-on-black or lacks an explicit foreground color.

This affects:
- "Provider notes" boxes
- Any other CLI output using styled boxes

## Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.25
- **Running in:** Docker container deployed via Dokploy
- **Terminal:** Dokploy web terminal (xterm.js-based)

## Steps to reproduce
1. Deploy Clawdbot Docker image via Dokploy
2. Open the container terminal in Dokploy's web UI
3. Run any command that outputs a styled box, e.g.:
   ```bash
   npx clawdbot models auth login --provider google-antigravity --set-default
   ```
4. Observe styled boxes — borders are visible, **content is invisible**

## Expected behavior
Box content should be readable with sufficient contrast against the background.

## Actual behavior
Box content is invisible. The text appears to be rendered in black (or with no explicit foreground color), which is unreadable against the dark terminal background.

## Workaround
Disable colors entirely:
```bash
NO_COLOR=1 npx clawdbot <command>
```

## Suggested fix
Ensure all styled box content uses an explicit foreground color that:
1. Contrasts with the box border/background
2. Falls back gracefully when terminal doesn't support full ANSI colors
3. Respects `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` environment variables

## Additional context
This is likely a color palette issue where the box library assumes certain terminal defaults. Web-based terminals (xterm.js) may not inherit the same default foreground colors as native terminals.
