## Description

## Bug Description

When configuring a default subagent model via `agents.defaults.subagents.model`, the setting is ignored and subagents always run on the parent session's model.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Set config:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "subagents": {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Spawn a subagent via `sessions_spawn`

3. The spawn response shows `modelApplied: true`

4. However, the subagent reports running as the parent model (e.g., `claude-opus-4-5`) instead of the configured model

## Expected Behavior

Subagents should run on the model specified in `agents.defaults.subagents.model` (or the per-spawn `model` parameter).

## Actual Behavior

- `modelApplied: true` is returned but the model is not actually changed
- Subagent runs on parent session's model regardless of config

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux

## Additional Context

Also tried passing `model` directly to `sessions_spawn` - same result. Both `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` and `claude-sonnet-4` formats were tested.
