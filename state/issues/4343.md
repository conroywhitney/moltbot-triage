## Description

## Describe the bug
Plain text message containing only the word "wait" (without slash command syntax) immediately aborts the active agent run on Telegram channel.

## To Reproduce
1. Configure Clawdbot with Telegram channel
2. Start an agent run (ask a question that triggers tool use)
3. While agent is processing, send plain text message: "wait"
4. Agent run aborts immediately with "Note: The previous agent run was aborted by the user."

## Expected behavior
Plain text "wait" should be treated as user input, not a command. Only `/wait` (if it were a registered command) should trigger special behavior.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Telegram
- Config: No custom "wait" command registered
- No plugin defining "wait" command found

## Additional context
- Checked config (no "wait" in commands.customCommands or native commands)
- Checked realtime-commands plugin (no "wait" handler)
- Checked Clawdbot source (/usr/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/src/) - no "wait" trigger found
- Only documented abort command is `/stop`
- Issue is reproducible every time

Workaround: Use alternative phrasing ("hang on", "hold on") instead of "wait".

This is a documented feature, not a bug.
