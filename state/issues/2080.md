## Description

I am very happy, that ClawdBot has memory with compaction supported out of the box.
But there are new emerging memory architectures that can enhance memory capacity and quality significantly, and they can be implemented as plugins. Most important I see are RLM(Recursive Language Models) since it can be outer memory loop, given CLI automation, and commands, all pieces are already there. Similarly there is MemU which uses very similar architecture to current memory system, but it's more advanced. 
Additionally, just as plugins normally are, should be able to use multiple memory plugins at the same time.

@IbrahimSaffi I'm building a plugin that does exactly this.  Would be happy to have you as a beta tester. 

### @IbrahimSaffi (2026-01-26)

Sorry for late response, I was sleeping.
Yes I will test it.

### @dial481 (2026-01-26)

We'll be releasing in the next day or two here, will add a link here.

This can be useful for having more token-efficient memory for this Plugin you are building.
I haven't checked this in detail, sorry if it's slop, just wanted you to know if it's useful component for plugin.

Feel free to become the very first beta tester: https://github.com/penfieldlabs/clawdbot-penfield

You will not be able to login unless you have [this fix](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/pull/2212) which has been merged but is more recent than the latest release. 

qmd looks interesting but different.

It solves a different problem:

- Penfield: "Remember this conversation/fact forever, access it anywhere"
- qmd: "Search my local Obsidian vault without burning 15k tokens"

However, both could be useful depending on your use case:

User indexes local vault with qmd → finds relevant notes
Stores important findings in Penfield for persistent cross-session memory
Penfield becomes the "curated knowledge" while qmd is "raw local files"

In addition to what qmd gives you, Penfield offers:

- AI-generated memories - qmd only indexes files you wrote. Penfield stores insights the AI generates during conversations.
- Knowledge graph connections - qmd has no connect tool, no relationship tracking
- Cross-device sync - qmd is local-only
- Document uploads - PDFs etc that aren't markdown

Will test, my screen is busted , I will buy it in few days and then I will test this memory system on PC.
On QMD search, I understand this difference. What I am getting at is reterivial since reterivial is involved in memory any way, and QMD is supposed to be token efficient reterivial, so integrating this in reterivial aspects of memory can make memory more token efficient.
Another suggestion is, in relation to RLM, one of crucial highlight of RLM as I understand is parallelization/multi-agentic setup, ClawdBot/Molty has Multi-agentic flow. So it can be useful to make addition of parallelization to this memory system so all those calls like RLM, happens via many subagents in parallel, so much more depth can be achieved. I have noticed that your memory system already make this possible, but it should exist as pre-existing flow too that can be turned On.
Suggesting both as future improvements to memory.

Beta accounts are free for the time being 🙂

> it should exist as pre-existing flow too that can be turned On

Can you explain what you mean by this?
