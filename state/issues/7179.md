## Description

### Environment
- OS: macOS 25.2 (arm64)
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1 (ed4529e)
- Node: v22.13.1
- Telegram Bot Token: [configured and paired]

### Description
OpenClaw's built-in message tool cannot send Telegram messages, returning `Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!` with `TypeError: fetch failed`.

However, direct curl requests to Telegram API work perfectly:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot[TOKEN]/sendMessage" -d "chat_id=[USER_ID]&text=test"
