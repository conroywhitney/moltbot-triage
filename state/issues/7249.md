## Description

## Summary

I want to use [Feature]: Claude Models via Azure service

## Proposed solution

Allow entry of both Azure API endpoint and API key for running claude-sonnet-4-5 and claude-opus-4-5

## Alternatives considered

Your current anthropic support allows entry of API key only, I would like to customise the API endpoint, pointing to Azure service.
