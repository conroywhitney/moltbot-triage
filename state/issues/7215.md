## Description

Telegram DM sessions not properly isolated per user. When User B DMs the bot, OpenClaw reuses User A session instead of creating new one.

Steps:
1. User A (977454767) has active DM session
2. User B (1207796178) sends DM
3. User A session gets reassigned to User B (same sessionId)
4. User B sees User A context

Impact: Privacy leak, GDPR concerns

Expected: agent:main:telegram:dm:{userId}
Actual: Single agent:main:main for all DMs

Version: 2026.1.30
