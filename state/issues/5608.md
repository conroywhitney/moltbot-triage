## Description

## Summary
The `message` tool with `action=send` for Telegram consistently fails with "Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!" error. However, direct curl calls to the same Telegram API endpoint using the same bot token work perfectly, indicating the issue is in OpenClaw's Telegram plugin HTTP handler, not in network/token/config.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Configure Telegram channel with valid bot token in `openclaw.json`
2. Verify incoming messages work (they do - bot receives messages fine)
3. Attempt to send a message using the message tool:
   ```
   message(action=send, channel=telegram, target=USER_ID, message='test')
   ```
4. Observe error: "Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!"

## Expected behavior
The message tool should successfully send the message via Telegram API, similar to how incoming messages are processed without issues.

## Actual behavior
The message tool fails with a network error. Meanwhile, the exact same API call via curl succeeds:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat_id":"USER_ID","text":"test from curl"}'
```
Returns: `{"ok":true,"result":{"message_id":336,...}}`

**What works:**
- ✅ Incoming Telegram messages received correctly
- ✅ Bot token is valid (verified with `/getMe` endpoint - returns 200)
- ✅ Network connectivity is fine (both Google and api.telegram.org reachable)
- ✅ Direct curl calls to Telegram API succeed

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ OpenClaw's message tool with Telegram channel
- ❌ Gateway restart doesn't fix it
- ❌ Config reapply doesn't fix it

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-90-generic (x64)
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): npm global install

## Logs or screenshots
No relevant logs found in journalctl or ~/.openclaw/*.log files. Gateway process is running (PID verified).

Config snippet (redacted):
```json
"channels": {
  "telegram": {
    "enabled": true,
    "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
    "botToken": "<REDACTED>",
    "allowFrom": ["myId"],
    "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
    "streamMode": "partial"
  }
}
```
