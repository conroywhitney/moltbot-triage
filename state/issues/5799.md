## Description

If you’ve noticed, we’re getting a PR roughly every two minutes. We love the energy, but no human team can review at that pace and maintain quality. So we’re locking down the core to make it rock solid.

New feature requests will be closed (and soon auto-closed). Bug reports are still welcome — stability work depends on them.

The good news: you probably don’t need a core change. OpenClaw is designed to be extensible without touching core:

- Skills — most “features” are really just skills. Write one, drop it in, done. No PR needed, nothing blocking you.
- CLIs & tooling — build around OpenClaw rather than into it. If it talks to the API, it doesn’t need to live in the repo.
- Your own fork — think “director’s cut,” but with TypeScript and fewer studio notes. Genuinely the fastest path if you want full control.

When we open back up, if you’ve built something genuinely great, PRs are welcome — but you’ll be competing with literally thousands of others, so think hard before posting. Drop it in #pr-thunderdome-dangerzone on Discord and read the topic first.

A more stable core means a better platform for everyone to build on. We’ll keep you posted.
