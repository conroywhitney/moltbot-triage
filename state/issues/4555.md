## Description

## Problem

Discord bot logs in successfully and can **send** messages, but **cannot receive** any messages. No MESSAGE_CREATE events are received.

## Environment

- **Clawdbot version**: 2026.1.24-3 (also tested with 2026.1.23-1)
- **Node.js version**: v25.4.0
- **OS**: macOS Darwin 25.2.0 (arm64)

## What works

- Bot logs in successfully
- Bot can send messages via API
- Bot appears online in Discord
- MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT is enabled
- All three Privileged Gateway Intents are enabled
- Bot has correct permissions
- **discord.js v14 can receive messages with the same token**

## What doesn't work

- Clawdbot never receives any Discord messages
- No messageCreate events in logs
- Both channel messages and DMs fail

## Logs

```
[discord] [default] Discord Message Content Intent is limited; bots under 100 servers can use it without verification.
[discord] [default] starting provider (@BotName)
[discord] logged in to discord as [BOT_ID]
```

No errors after login, but no message events either.

## Testing performed

1. Created multiple new Discord bots - same issue
2. Created new Discord server - same issue
3. Reinstalled Clawdbot - same issue
4. Downgraded to 2026.1.23-1 - same issue
5. **Tested with discord.js directly - works fine!**

### discord.js test (works):
```javascript
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';
const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
    GatewayIntentBits.DirectMessages
  ]
});
client.on('messageCreate', (m) => console.log(m.content));
client.login('TOKEN');
```

This script receives messages with the same bot token.

## Suspected cause

Issue appears to be in `@buape/carbon` library (v0.14.0). The intents in code look correct but messages are never received.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "enabled": true,
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "guilds": {
        "GUILD_ID": {
          "requireMention": false,
          "users": ["USER_ID"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
