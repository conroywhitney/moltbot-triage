## Description

## Problem

When the agent performs multi-step browser automation (e.g., placing an Uber Eats order), all intermediate progress is batched and only the final response is sent to the user.

This causes issues:
- User has no visibility into what's happening during long operations
- Can't interrupt or correct course mid-flow (e.g., "wait, I wanted to add something before checkout")
- Missed interstitials/confirmation dialogs because user doesn't see them in real-time
- By the time the user sees what happened, irreversible actions may have already been taken

## Proposed Solution

Allow the agent to stream intermediate status updates to the channel as tool calls progress, e.g.:
- "Opening checkout..."
- "Skipping upsell dialog..."
- "Placing order now..."

This would enable real-time feedback and let users intervene before irreversible actions.

## Use Case

Ordering food on Uber Eats — the agent clicked through an upsell interstitial and placed the order before I could say "wait, add those items too." By the time I saw the summary, the order was already submitted.

## Possible Implementation Ideas

- Agent emits `status` events that get forwarded to the channel in near-real-time
- Optional "narration mode" that streams tool call descriptions as they happen
- Hold/confirm gate before irreversible actions (configurable)
