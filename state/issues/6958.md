## Description

## Summary

When the assistant streams text followed immediately by a tool call, the TUI briefly displays the pre-tool text (~1 second), then it disappears. The text is correctly saved and reappears after reconnecting to the session or restarting the TUI.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Send a message that triggers a response with text followed by a tool call
2. Observe the TUI: text appears briefly, then vanishes when the tool card renders
3. Reconnect (`/session main`) or restart TUI
4. The missing text is now visible

## Expected behavior

Pre-tool-call text should persist in the TUI after tool cards render.

## Actual behavior

- Text streams in
- Tool call starts
- Pre-tool text disappears (TUI redraw issue?)
- After reconnect: full text visible

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30 (76b5208)
- OS: Arch Linux (Hyprland)
- Terminal: Ghostty
- Install method: npm global
- Verbose: on

## Notes

- Text is correctly stored (visible in webchat dashboard immediately, and in TUI after reconnect)
- Appears to be a TUI rendering/redraw issue during the stream→tool-call transition
- Similar pattern to #747 but not fallback-specific
