## Description

We added a temporary workaround to drop reasoning-only assistant turns for openai-responses in sanitizeSessionHistory.

TODO: remove the workaround once upstream pi-mono PR is merged:
- https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/838

Code:
- src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/google.ts (TODO REMOVE comment)
- src/agents/pi-embedded-runner.sanitize-session-history.test.ts
