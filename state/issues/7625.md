## Description

## Bug Description

The gateway crashes completely when a network request fails, instead of handling the error gracefully.

## Error

```
2026-02-03T01:52:13.791Z [clawdbot] Unhandled promise rejection: TypeError: fetch failed
    at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:14902:13
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)
clawdbot.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
```

## Impact

**Critical** - A simple network timeout/failure should not take down the entire gateway. This causes:
- Session disconnection
- Loss of conversation context
- Need to manually reconnect

## Expected Behavior

Network failures should be caught and logged, not crash the process. The gateway should continue running and either:
1. Retry the request
2. Return an error to the caller
3. At minimum, log and continue

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Node: v22.22.0
- OS: Ubuntu on Proxmox VM

## Workaround

Systemd auto-restart helps, but there's still a ~6 second disruption and session loss.
