## Description

## Description

The gateway crashes with \Unhandled promise rejection: TypeError: fetch failed\ when network requests timeout or fail.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run gateway normally
2. Network briefly drops or API times out
3. Gateway crashes instead of handling the error gracefully

## Expected Behavior

The gateway should catch fetch errors and retry, or at least not crash completely.

## Actual Behavior

\\\
[clawdbot] Unhandled promise rejection: TypeError: fetch failed
    at node:internal/deps/undici/undici:16416:13
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:104:5)
\\\

Gateway exits and requires restart.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Node.js: v25.4.0
- OS: Windows 11
- Channels: Telegram

## Workaround

Using a watchdog script to auto-restart, but this causes brief service interruptions.

## Suggestion

Add try/catch with retry logic around fetch calls, or use a fetch wrapper with automatic retries.
