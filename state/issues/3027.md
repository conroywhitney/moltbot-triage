## Description

## Feature Request

Add a configurable font size option for the webchat interface.

### Problem
Currently, users who want larger text in webchat must rely on browser zoom, which can cause UI breakages and layout issues. Browser zoom isn't well-tested across all UI states and can lead to a degraded experience.

### Proposed Solution
Add an official font size setting (either in webchat UI preferences or server config) that scales text without relying on browser zoom.

### Alternatives Considered
- Browser zoom (current workaround - causes layout issues)
- Browser accessibility settings (not granular enough)
- System display scaling (affects everything, not just webchat)

### Additional Context
This would improve accessibility and give users more control over their reading experience without risking UI breakage.
