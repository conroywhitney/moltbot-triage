## Description

Description:
The Telegram channel exits when getUpdates times out and does not automatically reconnect. This leaves the bot unresponsive until the gateway is manually restarted.

Environment:

• Moltbot version: 2026.1.27-beta.1
• Node: v22.22.0
• OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
• Telegram mode: long-polling (default)
Observed behavior:
The channel crashes roughly once per hour with this error:

[telegram] [default] channel exited: Request to 'getUpdates' timed out after 30 seconds

After exit, the channel does not restart. The gateway continues running but Telegram messages are not received.

Expected behavior:
The Telegram channel should retry with exponential backoff on transient failures (like the WhatsApp channel does), not exit permanently.

Workaround:
External watchdog script checking moltbot channels status every 2 minutes and running moltbot gateway restart when Telegram is down.

Logs:
