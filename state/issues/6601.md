## Description

## Summary
The `message` tool's `thread-create` action fails when targeting Discord forum channels (type 15) with the error: `This field is required`

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Have a Discord forum channel (type 15)
2. Attempt to create a thread/post using:
```json
{
  "action": "thread-create",
  "channelId": "<forum-channel-id>",
  "threadName": "Test",
  "message": "Test content"
}
```

## Expected Behavior
A new forum post should be created with the given name and initial message content.

## Actual Behavior
Returns error: `This field is required`

## Additional Context
- Forum channels use Discord's `GUILD_FORUM` type (15)
- The bot has appropriate permissions (SendMessages, ManageChannels, ManageMessages, etc.)
- Regular text channel threads may work fine - this is specific to forum channels
- Discord's forum post creation API requires different fields than regular thread creation

## Environment
- OpenClaw (latest)
- Discord.js integration
- Channel type: 15 (GUILD_FORUM)
