## Description

## Summary

When you select Whatsapp as the communication channel, it asks if I want to generate a QR code. Sure.
It renders the QR code in ASCII, but there are gaps in the lines which prevent the code from being readable, and the installer is now stuck waiting for a response to this.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Run install.sh
2. Select Whatsapp as the communication channel; asks if you want to generate a QR code. YES

## Expected behavior

Consider generating a QR code image that can be opened up from disk for better consistency. Or at least all ow the user to break out of the blocking event that is waiting for the QR code interaction so that they can make a different choice instead of having to ^C and start over.

## Actual behavior

It makes a valiant attempt to render an ASCII based QR code, but there are gaps between each line of text which results in an invalid/broken code on the MacOS Terminal Emulator.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30 (76b5208)
- OS: MacOS Sequoia 15.7.2
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): bash script
