## Description

## Summary

The Moltbot CLI (currently running version 2026.1.27-beta.1) is missing a standard way to generate ZSH shell completion scripts, making it difficult for users to integrate it cleanly into their shells. Tab completion is essential for quick usage and understanding of the cli tool.

Most modern CLIs provide a command like `moltbot completion zsh` or similar (e.g., `moltbot --print-completion zsh`) to output the necessary script, which users can then source in their `.zshrc`.

## Proposed Solution

Please add a subcommand or flag that allows users to pipe the ZSH completion script directly into their shell configuration.

Example desired usage (following common Node.js CLI patterns):

```bash
moltbot completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_moltbot
# OR
moltbot completion zsh | source
```

## Context

Current attempts to integrate completion failed because the standard commands (`moltbot completion zsh`, `moltbot --print-completion zsh`) are not recognized.

The file structure suggests a modern Node.js/Commander CLI, which typically supports this generation. A key goal is to enable the common pattern already used in my own `.zshrc` (for `autospec`):

```zsh
# >>> autospec completion >>>
autoload -U compinit && compinit
source <(autospec completion zsh)
# <<< autospec completion <<<
```

The new `moltbot` completion should support this same pattern for easy integration.

This would be a significant quality-of-life improvement for developers who use ZSH.
