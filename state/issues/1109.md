## Description

## Summary

When the agent makes multiple tool calls (e.g., searching, polling background processes), the webchat UI shows each call expanded, which can spam the conversation and make it hard to follow the actual response.

## Proposed Solution

Add an option to collapse tool call/result blocks by default in the webchat UI, with the ability to expand them on click.

Possible implementations:
- Collapsed by default with a "Show tool calls" toggle
- A config option like `webchat.collapsedToolCalls: true`
- Or auto-collapse after N tool calls in a single response

## Use Case

When doing research tasks (web searches, file reads, API calls), the agent may make 5-10+ tool calls. Currently all of these display fully expanded, pushing the actual answer far down and making the conversation noisy.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.16-2
- Channel: WebChat

+1 on this — running into the same issue daily. When the agent does research (web searches, file reads, API calls), 5-10 tool calls push the actual answer way down. A collapsible/collapsed-by-default toggle would be a huge UX win.

A config option like \webchat.collapsedToolCalls: true\ would be perfect.

### @yuvraj-jindal (2026-01-29)

I’m encountering the same issue. After adding a skill, when the agent invokes the corresponding API, the UI renders the full skill Markdown file and its raw response as output rather than just intended response.
