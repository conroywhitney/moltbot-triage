## Description

## Description

All cron operations (via tool or CLI) timeout after 10 seconds with a gateway websocket error.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a running gateway with cron jobs configured
2. Attempt any cron operation:
   - `openclaw cron list`
   - `openclaw cron remove <job-id>`
   - Or via the agent cron tool

## Expected Behavior

Cron operations should complete normally.

## Actual Behavior

```
Error: gateway timeout after 10000ms
Gateway target: ws://127.0.0.1:18789
Source: local loopback
Config: /Users/moltbot/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Bind: loopback
```

## Workaround

Manually edit `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` while the gateway is **fully unloaded**:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
echo '{"version":1,"jobs":[]}' > ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json
rm -f ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json.bak
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
```

**Note:** `launchctl stop` does not work because KeepAlive restarts the gateway immediately, and it overwrites jobs.json on shutdown.

## Environment

- **OpenClaw version:** 2026.1.30
- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 24.6.0 arm64)
- **Node:** v25.5.0
- **Gateway mode:** local, loopback bind

## Additional Context

The cron jobs themselves run fine (scheduled tasks execute). Only the management operations (list/add/remove) fail via the websocket interface.
