## Description

## Feature Request

Add optional rate-limiting for Telegram message handling to prevent concurrent message floods from overwhelming the session store.

## Use Case

When a user has multiple Telegram clients (desktop, mobile, web), each client may trigger webhook/polling events for the same messages. This creates bursts of concurrent requests that can cause lock contention (see related issue #4244).

## Suggested Implementation

Add a config option like:

```yaml
telegram:
  rateLimitMs: 100  # Debounce rapid-fire messages
  maxConcurrent: 2  # Max concurrent message handlers
```

## Benefits

- Prevents lock contention under load
- Graceful degradation instead of crashes
- User-configurable based on their setup
