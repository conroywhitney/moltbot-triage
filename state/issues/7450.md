## Description

## Problem
When an agent is executing a chain of tool calls, user messages queue until the chain completes. This means urgent messages (like 'STOP') don't interrupt the agent until it finishes its current work.

## Proposed Solution
Add a mechanism to interrupt tool execution when a priority message arrives from the user. Options:
1. Check for queued messages between tool calls
2. Allow certain message patterns (e.g., 'STOP') to abort the current run
3. Expose a 'check for messages' tool the agent can call

## Use Case
User sends 'STOP' while agent is running 5+ tool calls. Agent should see the message immediately, not after completing all 5 calls.

## Context
Requested by user who needs real-time interrupt capability for agent oversight.
