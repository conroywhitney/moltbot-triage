## Description

## Problem

When exec approvals are forwarded to chat channels (Discord, Telegram), users need to type the full UUID to approve:

`/approve 5dfdc8ca-494f-42d2-80e2-bd9e3afe3c04 allow-once`

This is painful on mobile — UUIDs are hard to select/copy in chat apps.

## Requested improvements

### 1. Partial ID matching
Allow the first 8 characters (the slug) to match:
`/approve 5dfdc8ca allow-once`

The exec tool already shows the short slug to the agent, so matching on it would be consistent.

### 2. Default to latest pending
When only one approval is pending:
`/approve allow-once`
Should resolve to the single pending request without requiring an ID.

### 3. Friendlier forwarded message
Include a pre-formatted copy-pasteable command in the forwarded DM.

## Context
- Running Clawdbot on a headless Linux VPS
- Approvals forwarded to Discord DMs via approvals.exec.targets
- Owner approves from mobile — typing full UUIDs is the main friction point
- The feature works great otherwise (allowlist + on-miss + Discord forwarding)
