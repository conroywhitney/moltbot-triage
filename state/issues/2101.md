## Description

## Summary

When `approvals.exec.mode: "session"` is enabled, and an exec command requires approval, the approval message is sent as plain text with an approval ID. Users must manually reply with `/approve <id> allow-once|allow-always|deny`.

## Request

Add inline Slack buttons (Allow Once / Allow Always / Deny) to exec approval messages when the Slack channel has `capabilities: ["inlineButtons"]` configured.

## Current behavior

Approval required (id a5c4d6cd). Approve to run; updates will arrive after completion. User must then type: `/approve a5c4d6cd allow-once`

## Desired behavior

Message includes interactive buttons:
- **Allow Once** → resolves approval for this run
- **Allow Always** → adds to allowlist + resolves
- **Deny** → blocks the command

This would make the approval UX much smoother, especially on mobile.

## Notes

- Slack plugin already declares `inlineButtons` capability
- The `message` tool supports inline buttons via the `buttons` parameter
- A similar pattern could be applied to Telegram/Discord channels that support inline keyboards
