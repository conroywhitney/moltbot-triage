## Description

## Problem

When a subagent spawned via `sessions_spawn` crashes or encounters an unhandled error, it takes down the entire gateway process. This requires a manual restart.

## Expected Behavior

Subagents should be isolated. If a subagent crashes:
1. The error should be caught and logged
2. The parent session should receive an error notification
3. The gateway should continue running

## Observed Behavior

- Spawned a subagent for a long-running task (PIFF Sprint 3 build)
- Subagent ran a few tool calls then died
- Gateway became unresponsive
- Required manual restart to recover

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Platform: Fly.io (Linux)
- Model: claude-opus-4-5

## Suggested Fix

Wrap subagent execution in try/catch at the session runner level. Use process isolation or at minimum ensure unhandled promise rejections in subagents don't propagate to crash the main event loop.
