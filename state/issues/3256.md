## Description

## Feature Request

### Problem
When using `voice_call` in `conversation` mode, the intro message is played to the recipient via TTS, but the conversation AI doesn't receive this context. This means the AI doesn't know the purpose of the call.

### Example
When I call someone with:
```
message: "Hej Ole! Henrik bad mig ringe og spørge hvordan din mor har det."
```

The recipient hears this, but when they respond, the AI starts fresh and asks generic questions like "How are you?" instead of following up on the stated purpose (asking about the mother).

### Expected Behavior
The intro message should be included in the conversation AI's context/system prompt, so it knows the purpose of the call and can follow up appropriately.

### Current Workaround
Include all context directly in the intro message so the recipient hears the full question, and repeat key info so the AI picks it up from the transcript.

### Suggested Implementation
- Add the intro message to the `responseSystemPrompt` dynamically for each call
- Or include it as the first message in the conversation history

### Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Plugin: @clawdbot/voice-call
- Provider: Twilio

### Real-world feedback

Just tested this in practice. Here's what happened:

1. Initiated an outbound conversation call with the message: *"Hej Henrik! Du ville høre om tyngdekraft. Tyngdekraft er den kraft der holder os på jorden..."*
2. The recipient heard the intro via TTS ✅
3. When the conversation AI took over, it had **zero context** about gravity
4. The recipient asked about gravity → AI responded with generic "What would you like to talk about?"
5. The AI kept asking what the caller wanted to discuss, completely ignoring the stated purpose

This makes conversation mode essentially broken for any directed outbound call. The intro message sets an expectation with the recipient that the AI then fails to meet.

**Environment:** Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3, Twilio provider, streaming enabled, OpenAI TTS (Nova)

Gentle bump on this one 🙂 

Still hitting this issue regularly with outbound conversation calls. Happy to provide more logs or test cases if helpful.
