## Description

## Problem

When using Clawdbot with a Claude Pro subscription, users may not realize that their main session has access to a much larger context window and isn't subject to the same token cost concerns as API-based usage.

I spent nearly $100 optimizing for token costs (trimming context files, using local models, etc.) before discovering I was on Claude Pro and didn't need to worry about context size in the main session.

## Current State

- The documentation mentions Claude Pro perks
- But there's no clear warning/callout during onboarding
- Users coming from other AI tools may default to "minimize tokens" thinking

## Suggestion

Add a check/notice during setup (or in BOOTSTRAP.md) that says something like:

```
✨ You're using Claude Pro!

Your main session has:
- Extended context window (200K tokens)
- No per-token API costs
- You can load full context without worrying about cost

Cost optimization is still useful for:
- Cron jobs using external APIs
- Sub-agents on paid models
- Sessions not using your Pro subscription
```

## Impact

Small issue, but expensive to discover through trial and error. A simple heads-up would save users time and money.

## Related

This came up after commit a2b727a where I trimmed ~1.5KB from workspace context to save tokens, only to learn afterward that it wasn't necessary for my setup.
