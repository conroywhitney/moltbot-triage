## Description

## Summary ## 

Cron jobs scheduled with kind: at and wakeMode: now fail to fire at their scheduled timestamp.

## Steps to reproduce ## 

1. Create a cron job with schedule: { kind: at, atMs: <future_timestamp> } and wakeMode: now

2. Wait until the scheduled time passes

3. Run cron runs <jobId> — shows empty entries: []

4. Run cron run <jobId> — returns { ok: true, ran: false, reason: not-due }

## Expected behavior ## 

Job should fire immediately when its scheduled time arrives, regardless of heartbeat cycle.

## Actual behavior ## 

Job never fires. The scheduler returns not-due even when the timestamp is in the past. The job is stored correctly but the scheduler does not recognize past-due timestamps for at jobs.

## Environment ## 

- Clawdbot version: 2026.2.1

- OS: Linux 6.12.62+rpt-rpi-2712 (arm64)

- Install method: npm

## Logs ## 

Job storage shows correct timestamp with wakeMode: now

``` json
{
  "id": "006a3d9d-f083-41d0-a52c-7564517d0a29",
  "schedule": { "kind": "at", "atMs": 1770088320000 },
  "wakeMode": "now",
  "state": {}
}

```

Running cron run returns not-due even though timestamp is past.

``` json
{ "ok": true, "ran": false, "reason": "not-due" }
```
