## Description

## Summary
Add support for per-agent skill restrictions via `skills.deny` / `skills.allow` in the agent config, similar to how `tools.deny` / `tools.allow` currently works.

## Current behavior
Skills can only be filtered:
- Globally via `skills.entries.{skillId}.enabled: false`
- At channel level via `channels.discord.guilds.*.channels.*.skills`

There's no way to restrict skills per-agent.

## Desired behavior
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "maya",
        "skills": {
          "deny": ["coding-agent", "github", "skill-creator"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Use case
Multi-agent setups where different agents have different roles. A social media agent shouldn't see coding skills. A real estate agent shouldn't see dev tools. This enables:
1. Cleaner agent focus (fewer irrelevant options)
2. Behavioral guardrails (can't use skills that don't exist for them)
3. Token savings (no skill descriptions for irrelevant skills in system prompt)

## Current workaround
TOOLS.md behavioral guidance telling agents to ask before using certain skills. Works but isn't enforced at the config level.
