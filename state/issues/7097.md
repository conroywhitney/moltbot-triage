## Description

## Proposal
Add Chinese version of Telegram commands to make OpenClaw more accessible to Chinese users.

## Background
In China, OpenClaw has gained tremendous popularity with over 1 million deployments across various user groups. The user base spans from:
- **Enterprise managers (40-50 years old)** who need AI assistants for business operations
- **University students** from various majors using OpenClaw for research and learning
- **Stay-at-home parents** utilizing AI for daily tasks and child education
- **Middle school students** exploring AI technology for educational purposes

Many of these users are not proficient in English, which creates a barrier when using Telegram commands like `/start`, `/help`, `/new`, `/reset`, `/status`, `/model`, `/reasoning`, and `/memory`.

## Suggested Solution
Add Chinese equivalents for the existing Telegram commands:
- `/start` → `/开始` (or `/启动`)
- `/help` → `/帮助`
- `/new` → `/新建`
- `/reset` → `/重置`
- `/status` → `/状态`
- `/model` → `/模型`
- `/reasoning` → `/推理`
- `/memory` → `/记忆`

## Benefits
1. **Lower barrier to entry** - Chinese users can interact with OpenClaw in their native language
2. **Broader adoption** - Makes OpenClaw accessible to non-English speaking demographics
3. **Better user experience** - Users feel more comfortable with familiar commands
4. **Increased engagement** - More users will actively use all features when commands are understandable

## Implementation Consideration
The Chinese commands could be added as aliases to the existing English commands, so both versions work simultaneously. This maintains backward compatibility while adding accessibility.

Thank you for considering this feature request. OpenClaw has been incredibly valuable to the Chinese community, and this addition would make it even more inclusive.

### @db-root (2026-02-02)

I agree with your idea, because many user groups in China are optimistic about the project. It is not that they are not bad at English, but they hope to bring convenience through AI. They hope to optimize Chinese support, their own documents and communities.
