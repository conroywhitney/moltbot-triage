## Description

## Description
When using WhatsApp in `selfChatMode: true`, proactive outbound messages sent via the `message` tool are reported as successful by the gateway but never arrive on the user's phone.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Node: v22.22.0
- OS: Ubuntu Linux
- WhatsApp config: selfChatMode enabled, allowlist with owner number

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure WhatsApp with `selfChatMode: true` and `allowFrom: ["+1234567890"]` (your own number)
2. Start gateway and link WhatsApp
3. Use CLI or webchat (not WhatsApp) to send a proactive message via message tool
4. Gateway logs show success: `Sent message <id> -> <jid> (90ms)`
5. Message never arrives on WhatsApp

## Expected Behavior
Proactive messages should arrive on WhatsApp even in selfChatMode.

## Actual Behavior
- Gateway reports message sent successfully
- Logs show no errors
- Message ID is returned
- But message never appears on WhatsApp

## Logs
```
Sending message -> 526531152532@s.whatsapp.net
Sent message 3EB08C335D28D2BC726F3D -> 526531152532@s.whatsapp.net (90ms)
```

## Notes
- Reactive messages (replies to user messages) work perfectly
- Only proactive/initiated messages fail to arrive
- This breaks cron-based notifications and scheduled reports
- Tested multiple times with same result
