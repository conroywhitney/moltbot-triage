## Description

## Summary

I’m a Perplexity Pro user and I’d love to plug my existing Perplexity models into Openclaw the same way I can with Anthropic, Google, Grok, etc. Right now the only Perplexity‑related option I can see is a hidden Sonar model, and it doesn’t show up as a normal provider during setup. That means I’m paying for a Perplexity subscription I can’t really use inside Openclaw, even though the pplx‑api already exists. [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-pplx-api)

## Proposed solution

`I’d like, and I truly believe other PPLX [Pro & Max] Subs would love to see Perplexity to be added as a First‑Class provider in the Inititalization/Set-up` **_{Providers Config}_** `and the ability to change/swap models in the TUI:`

- Let me paste a **Perplexity pplx‑api key** and base URL the same way I do for Anthropic (Claude) or Google during Init.-Setup.  (Also would need a way to choose pplx-models) 
- Expose the **Perplexity model list** (Sonar Pro and any others my account can see) so I can pick them in the model selector, not just a single hard‑coded Sonar preset.
- Show “Perplexity” in the **model/auth provider** list during setup, so I can choose it when I’m wiring up my Openclaw instance.  
- Allow routing/fallback rules so Perplexity can be used alongside Anthropic, Google, Moonshot, etc., in the normal way.

## Alternatives considered

- Just sticking with Anthropic + Google inside Openclaw and using Perplexity only in its own UI. This works, but it splits my workflows across tools and wastes the Perplexity quota I’m already paying for.  
- Manually building a proxy service that calls pplx‑api and pretending it’s another provider. Possible, but brittle and way more complexity than having native support.

## Additional context & Sources

Perplexity already documents PPLX_API ~&~ SONAR_PRO_API publicly, so it feels like a natural fit for Openclaw’s provider system. [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-the-sonar-pro-api)

> Having Perplexity as a proper provider would be a big win for users who prefer its models and search behavior but want Openclaw to be the central “brain” that ties everything together.
