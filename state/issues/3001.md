## Description

## Severity: Low

## Description
While many endpoints validate input, a comprehensive review of all HTTP endpoints is needed to ensure consistent input validation.

## Location
- Various HTTP handlers throughout the codebase

## Risk
Missing input validation can lead to:
- Injection attacks
- Unexpected behavior
- Denial of service

## Recommendation
- Implement input validation middleware for all user-facing endpoints
- Use schema validation (Zod, Joi, etc.) for request bodies
- Validate query parameters and path parameters
- Document expected input formats
