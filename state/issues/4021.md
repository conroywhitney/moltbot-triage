## Description

## Summary

Azure offers a wide range of AI and cloud services that can enhance Moltbot. With PR #3675 adding Azure OpenAI model support, I'd like to discuss a roadmap for comprehensive Azure integration.

## Current Status

| Service | Status | PR/Issue |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Azure OpenAI (Models) | 🟡 In Progress | #3675 by @haxudev |
| Azure Speech TTS | ✅ Implemented & Tested | #3144 (closed - PR too large) |
| Azure Speech STT | ✅ Implemented & Tested | #3144 (closed - PR too large) |

## Background

I previously submitted PR #3144 which included **working implementations** of:
- Azure OpenAI provider (including GPT-5.2)
- Azure Speech TTS
- Azure Speech STT

### Testing Status

All features have been tested and verified working on version `2026.1.27-beta`:

- ✅ **Azure OpenAI GPT-5.2** - Successfully tested and working
- ✅ **Azure Speech TTS** - Successfully tested and working
- ✅ **Azure Speech STT** - Successfully tested and working

> Note: This addresses the question from @Takhoffman on PR #3144 about whether GPT-5.2 was tested - yes, it has been tested successfully.

The PR was closed because the scope was too large (1000+ lines), not due to code quality issues. I understand the concern about reviewing large PRs and am happy to break this into smaller, focused PRs for easier review.

## Proposed Approach

Since the code is already implemented and tested, I can:

1. **Extract Azure Speech TTS** (~200 lines) - Submit as a small, focused PR
2. **Extract Azure Speech STT** (~200 lines) - Submit as a separate small PR

This way, each PR is <300 lines and easy to review, while still delivering the full Azure Speech functionality.

### Phase 2: Extended Services (Future consideration)

3. **Azure Translator** - Multi-language translation
4. **Azure Content Safety** - Content moderation
5. **Azure Communication Services** - SMS/Voice calls

## Questions for Maintainers

1. Is comprehensive Azure support a direction the project wants to pursue?
2. Since the code is already implemented and tested, should I extract TTS and STT into separate small PRs?
3. Any architectural preferences for aligning with PR #3675's approach?
4. Would you like to see the existing implementation before I split it up?

## Related

- #3675 - Azure OpenAI provider by @haxudev (in review, approved)
- #3144 - My previous Azure PR with **working TTS/STT** (closed due to size, not quality)

Happy to align on the approach. I can have the small PRs ready quickly since the implementation is already done and tested!
