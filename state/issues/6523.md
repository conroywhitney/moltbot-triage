## Description

## Problem

When `agents.defaults.typingMode` is set to `"message"`, the typing indicator still fires for responses that only contain a reaction (no text reply). According to the docs, `message` mode should only start typing on the "first non-silent text delta" and should ignore `NO_REPLY` silent tokens.

## Expected Behavior

With `typingMode: "message"`:
- Typing indicator should **only** fire when the model actually starts outputting text
- Reactions sent via the `message` tool (without a text reply) should **not** trigger typing
- `NO_REPLY` responses should **not** trigger typing

## Actual Behavior

The typing indicator fires as soon as the model run begins, regardless of whether the response will be text or just a reaction. This defeats the purpose of `message` mode.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Set `agents.defaults.typingMode: "message"` in config
2. Send a message via **Signal** channel
3. Have the agent respond with only a reaction (using `message` tool with `action: react`) and `NO_REPLY`
4. Observe that typing indicator still appears on the sender's device

## Workaround

Setting `typingMode: "never"` correctly suppresses all typing indicators, confirming the setting is being read. But this removes typing feedback for actual text replies too.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- **Channel: Signal** (signal-cli 0.13.23, JSON-RPC daemon mode)
- OS: macOS 26.2 (arm64)

## Notes

- This was only tested on Signal — unclear if other channels (Telegram, Discord, etc.) have the same behavior
- May be a Signal-specific issue in how typing indicators are sent, or a core issue in the typing mode pipeline

## Analysis

It appears the typing indicator is being sent at the start of message processing, before the model decides whether to output text or just react. The `typingMode` check seems to happen too late in the pipeline — or the Signal channel may be sending typing independently of the core typingMode logic.
