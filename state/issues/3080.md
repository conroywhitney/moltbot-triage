## Description

## Description

When Clawdbot sends voice notes via Telegram, the playback order is reversed. After listening to one voice note, Telegram automatically plays the **previous** message instead of the **next** one.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Have Clawdbot send multiple voice messages in a conversation
2. Listen to a recent voice note until it finishes
3. Telegram automatically plays the previous voice note (going backwards in time)

## Expected behavior

Voice notes should play forward chronologically, not backward.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- TTS provider: Edge TTS (also occurred with ElevenLabs)
- Edge TTS config: `fr-FR-HenriNeural`, `audio-24khz-48kbitrate-mono-mp3`
- Telegram client: iOS (latest)

## Additional context

This issue does **not** occur with voice notes from other contacts — only with Clawdbot's messages. This suggests the issue may be related to how the audio is sent (possibly `sendAudio` vs `sendVoice` API, or missing metadata).

The voice notes display as:
- "Voice" with an ID number
- "Unknown artist"
- Timer showing `0:00 / 0:24` format

Instead of the normal round voice bubble with waveform.
