## Description

## Problem

When Clawdbot connects to Matrix with E2EE enabled, it cannot complete device verification. This means all messages sent by the bot appear with an "unverified device" warning to other users in the room.

From the docs:
> When E2EE is enabled, the bot will request verification from your other sessions on startup. Open Element (or another client) and approve the verification request to establish trust.

In practice, the bot can *request* verification but cannot complete the interactive verification flow (emoji comparison, QR code, etc.) that Matrix clients use to establish device trust.

## Expected behavior

Clawdbot should be able to:
1. Complete interactive device verification with another Matrix session (e.g., respond to emoji verification prompts)
2. Or provide a CLI/API mechanism to mark the device as verified
3. Or support cross-signing so the device is automatically trusted once the account is verified

## Current workaround

Users see "unverified" warnings on all bot messages. There's no way to resolve this without manually trusting the device in each client, which doesn't persist properly.

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Matrix plugin with E2EE enabled
- Self-hosted homeserver (Synapse)

## Additional context

This affects the UX for anyone using Clawdbot in encrypted Matrix rooms — the constant warnings undermine trust in the bot's messages.
