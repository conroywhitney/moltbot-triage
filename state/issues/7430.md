## Description

## Environment
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, x64)
- Node: v22.22.0
- OpenClaw: 2026.2.1
- Gateway: ws://127.0.0.1:18789
- VPS: DigitalOcean 2GB droplet (Frankfurt)

## Issue Summary
Telegram channel successfully receives messages and AI processes them, but responses are never sent back to Telegram. The bot appears completely unresponsive from the user's perspective.

## Logs
```
20:19:42 embedded run start: messageChannel=telegram
20:20:05 embedded run done: durationMs=22856 aborted=false
[NO LOGS SHOWING MESSAGE SENT TO TELEGRAM]
```

## Status
```
Telegram │ ON │ OK │ accounts 1/1
```

## What Works
✅ Messages received from Telegram
✅ AI processing completes successfully  
✅ `openclaw status` shows Telegram as "OK"

## What Doesn't Work
❌ No responses sent back to Telegram
❌ No logs showing message delivery
❌ Bot appears dead to users

## Troubleshooting Attempted
- Removed all Telegram sessions
- Restarted gateway multiple times
- Verified bot token is valid
- Checked no other instances running
- Fixed config workspace paths

## Impact
Makes Telegram integration completely unusable for mobile access.
