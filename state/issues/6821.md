## Description

## Summary
When running multiple agents through a single Discord bot, all replies appear as the bot user (e.g. "Agent"). This makes it impossible to visually distinguish which agent sent a message.

## Proposed Solution
Add optional webhook routing for Discord replies. Each agent could have a configured webhook URL, and OpenClaw would send replies through that webhook instead of the bot user.

**Config example:**
```json5
agents: {
  list: [
    {
      id: "aksel",
      identity: { name: "Aksel", emoji: "🎯" },
      discord: {
        webhook: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Current Workaround
- Send messages via `exec` + `curl` to webhook URL
- Reply with `NO_REPLY` to suppress bot message
- Works but is manual and requires agents to remember the pattern

## Why This Matters
Multi-agent Discord setups need visual identity per agent. Webhooks provide custom username/avatar per message, enabling proper agent identity.

## Additional Context
Discovered that Discord webhooks with `allowBots: true` DO trigger bound agents (unlike bot self-messages which are filtered). This enables agent-to-agent communication through Discord when each agent sends via their own webhook.
