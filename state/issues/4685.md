## Description

### Summary
The webchat interface (Gateway Dashboard Chat) currently lacks UI controls for uploading images or files, even though the backend appears to support image processing via tools.media.image and gateway.http.endpoints.responses.

### Current behavior
- No attachment button visible in webchat input area
- Paste (Cmd+V) doesn't work for screenshots
- Drag-and-drop doesn't work for images

### Expected behavior
- Attachment button (📎) near message input
- Support for drag-and-drop images
- Support for paste (Cmd+V) screenshots
- File picker for images/documents

### Why it matters
WhatsApp and other channels support image uploads. Having parity in the webchat UI would make it more useful for desktop users who want to share screenshots or documents without switching to their phone.

### Workarounds
- Use WhatsApp/Telegram/other channels that support attachments
- Share images via URL and use web_fetch
