## Description

## Summary
When an agent manages conversations with multiple parties via the `message` tool (e.g., user A asks agent to chat with user B on WhatsApp), **plain text responses go to whoever sent the triggering message**, not the session owner.

## Example scenario
1. Matija (session owner) asks agent to message Stefano
2. Agent uses `message` tool to send to Stefano ✅
3. Stefano replies, triggering agent turn
4. Agent uses `message` tool to reply to Stefano ✅
5. Agent writes plain text "Update for Matija..."
6. ❌ Plain text goes to Stefano (message sender), not Matija (session owner)

## Current behavior
This is technically correct — responses go to the message sender. But it's a UX footgun when agents manage multi-party conversations.

## Suggested improvement
1. **Documentation**: Add a note in docs about this pattern — agents should use `message` tool for ALL outbound messages in multi-party scenarios and end with `NO_REPLY`
2. **Optional**: Consider adding a warning when an agent mixes `message` tool calls with plain text responses in the same turn

## Workaround
Agents should:
- Use `message` tool for replies to all parties
- Use `message` tool explicitly to update the session owner
- End the turn with `NO_REPLY` to avoid accidental sends
