## Description

## Description

When a user forwards a message with a large file (>20MB) to the Telegram bot, the handler fails with `GrammyError: Call to 'getFile' failed! (400: Bad Request: file is too big)` and the message is silently dropped. The user receives no feedback.

## Current Behavior

The error handling in `dist/telegram/bot-handlers.js` (around line 485) checks for:
```javascript
if (errMsg.includes("exceeds") && errMsg.includes("MB limit"))
```

But the actual error from Telegram Bot API says `file is too big`, which doesn't match this condition.

## Expected Behavior

The bot should catch this error and respond to the user with a message like "⚠️ File too large. Maximum size is 20MB." (the code for this response already exists, just the condition doesn't match).

## Suggested Fix

Change the condition to also match the Telegram API error:
```javascript
if ((errMsg.includes("exceeds") && errMsg.includes("MB limit")) || errMsg.includes("file is too big"))
```

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Platform: Amazon Linux 2023 / EC2
- Telegram channel

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Forward a message containing a video or file larger than 20MB to the bot
2. Observe that the bot doesn't respond at all
3. Check logs: `handler failed: GrammyError: Call to 'getFile' failed! (400: Bad Request: file is too big)`
