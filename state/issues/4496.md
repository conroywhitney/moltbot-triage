## Description

## Summary

Add support for OpenAI's built-in web search tool via the Responses API, as an alternative provider for `web_search`.

## Motivation

Users with OpenAI/Codex subscriptions (especially Team/Pro plans) already have access to OpenAI's built-in web search through the Responses API. Currently, OpenClaw's `web_search` only supports:
- Brave Search API
- Perplexity Sonar (direct or via OpenRouter)

This means users need to obtain additional API keys even when they already have working web search through their OpenAI subscription (e.g., via Codex CLI).

## Proposed Solution

Add a new provider option for `web_search`:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    web: {
      search: {
        provider: "openai-builtin",  // new option
        // Uses the configured OpenAI provider's Responses API
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This would leverage OpenAI's Responses API with the built-in `web_search` tool, similar to how Codex CLI handles it.

## Benefits

1. **No additional API keys needed** for users with OpenAI subscriptions
2. **Consistent experience** with other OpenAI tools (Codex CLI, etc.)
3. **Leverages existing auth** - works with OAuth (openai-codex) or API keys

## Technical Notes

- OpenAI Responses API: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses
- The API supports `tools: [{type: "web_search"}]` natively
- Would need to route through the configured OpenAI provider's credentials

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.24-3
- Using cliproxyapi with Codex OAuth authentication
