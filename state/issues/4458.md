## Description

### Summary
The Control UI in Safari fails to render the password input dialog when `gateway.auth.mode` is set to `password`. The UI immediately shows "disconnected (1008): unauthorized: gateway password missing (enter the password in Control UI settings)" without ever displaying the settings page where you could enter the password.

Chrome works correctly with the same configuration.

### Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **macOS:** Tahoe 26.2 (arm64 / Apple Silicon)
- **Safari:** Version 26.2
- **Gateway bind:** loopback (127.0.0.1:18789)
- **Auth mode:** password

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure gateway with password auth:
   ```json
   "gateway": {
     "auth": {
       "mode": "password",
       "password": "somepassword"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` in Safari
3. Observe error immediately without any password prompt

### Expected Behavior
Safari should display the Control UI settings page or a password prompt, allowing the user to enter the gateway password.

### Actual Behavior
Safari shows "disconnected (1008): unauthorized: gateway password missing" and loops reconnection attempts. Private/incognito window has the same behavior. Clearing caches, emptying site data, and hard refresh do not help.

### Gateway Logs
Safari sends `authProvided: "none"` (no credentials):
```json
{
  "authMode": "password",
  "authProvided": "none",
  "authReason": "password_missing",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.2 Safari/605.1.15"
}
```

### Workaround
Use Chrome or another Chromium-based browser (Arc, Edge, Brave).

Alternatively, switch to token auth and use the tokenized URL directly.

I meet this too,fix by "openclaw uninstall" and reinstall openclaw with "curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash",until pass the guide "Generate and configure a gateway token now?".Maybe has a way to generate new token?
