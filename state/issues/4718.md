## Description

Summary

What went wrong?

When using Clawdbot with the Telegram provider, asking the agent to create a GitLab repository consistently results in an HTTP 400 error:

HTTP 400: Invalid 'messages[2].tool_calls[0].id': string too long.
Expected a string with maximum length 40, but got a string with length 438 instead.


This happens every time the request triggers a tool call. As a result, the Telegram bot cannot complete the task and does not respond.

Steps to reproduce

Install and run Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3

Configure the Telegram provider with a valid bot token

Configure an agent using model chatgpt-5.2

Start the gateway:

clawdbot gateway


Send a message to the Telegram bot, for example:

“Create a new repository on GitLab named test-repo under my account.”

Expected behavior

What did you expect to happen?

The agent should invoke the GitLab-related tool to create a repository

tool_calls should be generated with a valid schema

The request should succeed or fail gracefully (e.g. authentication error), not with a schema validation error

Actual behavior

What actually happened?

The agent attempts to perform a tool call

Clawdbot returns an HTTP 400 error from the upstream API:

Invalid 'messages[2].tool_calls[0].id': string too long.
Expected a string with maximum length 40, but got a string with length 438 instead.


The error occurs consistently whenever this action is requested

No response is sent back to the Telegram bot

Environment

Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3

OS: Linux (cloud VM, headless)

Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): Node.js via nvm (Node v22.x), running via systemd

Model: chatgpt-5.2

Provider: Telegram (long polling)

Logs or screenshots

Paste relevant logs or add screenshots (redact secrets).

HTTP 400: Invalid 'messages[2].tool_calls[0].id': string too long.
Expected a string with maximum length 40, but got a string with length 438 instead.

I reset my session.json in .clawdbot/agent/main/sessions/session.json and restart gateway fix, but calwdbot lose memory
