## Description

I can’t send images to a Telegram group via OpenClaw’s `message` tool. Every send attempt fails immediately with:

```json
{ "status": "error", "tool": "message", "error": "Use `target` instead of `to`/`channelId." }
```

This blocks sending media (and seems to block sending at all in my setup). The error looks like a tool/schema validation mismatch (e.g. `to` vs `target`) rather than a Telegram API error.

Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.1.29 (commit a5b4d22cbff07a1bfd01a41391b7e071e1d9074d)
- OS: macOS 26.2 (Darwin 25.2.0, arm64)

Question
What is the correct `message.send` schema for Telegram (group) sends, and which component needs updating if the UI/tool wrapper still uses `to`/`channelId`?
