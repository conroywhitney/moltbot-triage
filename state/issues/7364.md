## Description

## Summary

When the agent executes commands, I simply have no clue what the agent is executing, and clicking on the call doesn't reveal any additional information. 

## Proposed solution

Show the command that was ran in full, alongside the response (ideally). Right now, only the first command is shown so if the agent runs `cd ~ && wget https://example.com` then only the first command is going to be visible.
