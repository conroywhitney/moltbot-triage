## Description

## Context
On WSL2 (Ubuntu), `systemd` user sessions often fail to initialize the DBus socket (`/run/user/1000/bus`) properly on boot. This breaks **all** systemd-dependent services, including the OpenClaw Gateway and Browser Service.

## The Fix
`sudo systemctl restart user@$(id -u).service` reliably restores the session.

## Proposal
1.  **Docs:** Add a troubleshooting guide.
2.  **Doctor:** Update `openclaw doctor` to check for:
    - WSL Environment.
    - Presence of `/run/user/$(id -u)/bus`.
    - If missing, suggest the restart command above.
