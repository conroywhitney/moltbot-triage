## Description

## Summary

We built a community triage dashboard for this repo: **[conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/)**

It mirrors all open issues and PRs via the GitHub GraphQL API, generates actionable views as a GitHub Pages site, and is designed to help maintainers prioritize the 600+ issues and 480+ PRs currently open.

## The Problem

As of today:
- **602 open issues**, **487 open PRs**
- **88% of PRs have zero reviews**
- **60% of PRs have failing CI**
- 12 PRs over 1,000 lines changed

Contributors submit PRs. Maintainers don't have bandwidth to review them all. Good work gets buried. This is normal for a popular project — but what if the community could help surface what matters most?

## What We Built

A GitHub Pages dashboard organized by **action**, not just data:

| Page | Who it's for | What it answers |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| [Ready to Merge](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/prs/ready.html) | Maintainers | "Which PRs can I merge right now?" |
| [Failing CI](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/prs/failing.html) | Contributors | "Which PRs need CI fixes?" |
| [Huge PRs](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/prs/huge.html) | Maintainers | "Which PRs need to be split or aligned first?" |
| [All PRs](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/prs/all.html) | Everyone | Sortable, filterable, searchable table |
| [Trending Issues](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/issues/trending.html) | Everyone | "What does the community care about?" |
| [Repo Health](https://conroywhitney.github.io/clawd-triage/health.html) | Maintainers | Size distribution, CI health, contributor activity |

**Technical details:**
- Data synced via GitHub GraphQL API (issues with body + comments, PRs with reviews + CI status)
- Secrets in mirrored content automatically scrubbed before commit
- All scoring thresholds in a single `config.yml` — no magic numbers
- Static HTML + JSON, no server needed
- Source: [github.com/conroywhitney/clawd-triage](https://github.com/conroywhitney/clawd-triage)

## Why This Matters for Moltbot Specifically

Every Moltbot instance is an AI-human pair with access to `gh` CLI. This means:
- Agents can help their humans discover relevant issues before submitting duplicates
- Community signal (reactions, reviews, engagement) can be aggregated and surfaced automatically
- Maintainers get a pre-filtered view instead of scrolling through 487 PRs

## What We're Proposing

1. **Feedback on the dashboard** — Is this useful? What views are missing? What would make triage easier?
2. **If there's interest**, we'd love to contribute this as an official tool — potentially at `moltbot.github.io/triage`
3. **Future direction**: A `moltbot vote` skill that lets agent-human pairs express priorities on issues/PRs via GitHub reactions + structured comments, with the dashboard aggregating that signal

We're intentionally starting small — a read-only dashboard, no bot comments, no automation touching the main repo. Just a better lens on what's already here.
