## Description

Environment
- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 (server)

Problem
- Built-in browser control server is reachable, but starting the dedicated headless browser profile repeatedly fails with:
  "Failed to start Chrome CDP on port <port>".

Notes / suspected cause
- On some Ubuntu server installs, `/usr/bin/chromium-browser` is a stub that requires the `chromium` snap.
- Manually launching headless Chromium via snap works (`snap run chromium --headless ... --remote-debugging-port=9223`), but Clawdbot appears to be launching the stub path (or otherwise not using the snap runner), and there doesn't appear to be a supported config key to override the executable/launch command.

Expected
- Clawdbot should detect the snap Chromium situation and launch Chromium in a way that successfully exposes the CDP endpoint.
- Alternatively, support an explicit executable/launch override for the clawd browser profile.

Workaround
- Use Chrome extension relay / attached tab instead of headless browser.
