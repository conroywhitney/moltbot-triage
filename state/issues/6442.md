## Description

## Summary

When using the **Synthetic provider** with **Kimi K2.5** in OpenClaw, the model’s *thinking / reasoning* text is shown to the user as normal output (i.e., it appears in the assistant response body). I would assume that it should not be spent because it is not really useful to me in this form. It looks like Synthetic returns an Anthropic-style `content[]` with a `type:"thinking"` block and OpenClaw is not consistently treating that block as hidden reasoning / respecting “reasoning visibility”.  

References:
- OpenClaw supports controlling thinking depth and reasoning visibility (off/on/stream)
- Moonshot docs show Kimi K2.5 can run with thinking disabled via request params (`"thinking": {"type":"disabled"}`), so exposing thinking should be optional
- OpenClaw release notes mention Kimi K2.5 added to Synthetic catalog


## Steps to reproduce

1. Install / run OpenClaw **v2026.1.30**.
2. Configure Synthetic provider with `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` and set default model to:
   - `synthetic/hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5`
3. In the OpenClaw Web UI (or embedded agent), send a normal prompt (e.g. “Say hi briefly and ask what I want to do next.”)
4. Observe the assistant response: the message includes the model’s internal reasoning / planning text as plain, user-visible output

(Optional confirmation)
5. Call Synthetic directly via Anthropic-compatible endpoint and observe it returns `content[]` containing a `{"type":"thinking", ...}` block (so OpenClaw should likely treat it as “reasoning” rather than user-facing text)


## Expected behavior

- OpenClaw should **not display thinking blocks** as normal assistant text when “reasoning visibility” is off, and should instead either:
  - hide `type:"thinking"` blocks by default, or
  - render them in a separate “Reasoning”/collapsible channel that respects the configured reasoning visibility.
- For Kimi K2.5 specifically, it should be possible to run with thinking disabled (or at least not forced visible), consistent with Kimi API behavior


## Actual behavior

The assistant response includes verbose internal planning / reasoning as plain output. Example (trimmed):

The user wants me to:
- Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences)
- Ask what they want to do next
...
I should keep it brief and friendly...
Hey USERNAME! 👋 Fresh session, ready to go. What's on your mind?


## Environment

- Clawdbot / OpenClaw version: **OpenClaw 2026.1.30** (from `openclaw models status`)
- OS: **Ubuntu Linux (server / VPS)**
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): **the curl install command**


## Logs or screenshots

Synthetic direct call returns an Anthropic-style response with a `thinking` block, e.g.:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "The user just sent \"ping\" ... I should respond ..."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "pong! 👋 ..."
    }
  ]
}
