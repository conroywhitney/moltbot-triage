## Description

## Summary
When the Gateway restarts at (or very close to) a cron job's scheduled execution time, the job is silently skipped with no record of the miss.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Schedule a cron job (e.g., `0 21 * * *`)
2. Gateway restarts at 21:00:21 (just after the scheduled time)
3. After restart, the job's `nextRunAtMs` is updated to the next occurrence (e.g., next day 09:00)
4. No execution record, no "missed" status logged

## Expected Behavior
At least one of:
- **Catchup execution**: On startup, detect jobs with `nextRunAtMs` in the past and execute them
- **Missed status**: Record `lastStatus: "missed"` so users can see the job was skipped
- **Configurable behavior**: Option like `catchupOnRestart: true` per job

## Actual Behavior
- Job is silently skipped
- `nextRunAtMs` is updated to the next scheduled time
- No indication in `cron.runs` or job state that execution was missed

## Context
Discovered when a scheduled market report (9:00, 15:00, 21:00) didn't fire — Gateway had restarted at 21:00:21 due to network issues.

## Environment
- Clawdbot Gateway
- macOS (arm64)
