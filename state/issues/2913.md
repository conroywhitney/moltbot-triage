## Description

The current README file lacks clear instructions for new contributors,
especially regarding setup and contribution workflow.

This issue proposes improving the README by:
- Adding clearer installation steps
- Explaining how to fork, create a branch, and submit a pull request
- Improving overall readability

This enhancement will help new contributors get started more easily.
