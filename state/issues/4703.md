## Description

## Summary
I want "read only" access to Discord, Slack, Google Chat, and Matrix.

## Proposed solution
Use the same pattern used by Telegram and WhatsApp to gate sendMessage using the config

## Alternatives considered
Not deeply, mainly because this is extending an existing pattern that's already implemented by other channels.

## Additional context
I'll be posting a PR shortly
