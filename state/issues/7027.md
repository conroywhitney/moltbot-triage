## Description

## Summary
OpenClaw's Telegram plugin currently handles `message` updates (DMs + groups) but not `channel_post` updates from broadcast channels.

## Context
- grammY (the underlying library) supports `channel_post` in `DEFAULT_UPDATE_TYPES`
- The bot can be added as channel admin with read permissions
- But channel posts don't create sessions or trigger the agent

## Use Case
User wants their agent to monitor/respond to posts in a Telegram broadcast channel they admin.

## Suggested Implementation
1. Add handler for `channel_post` updates in the Telegram plugin
2. Add `channelPolicy` / `channelAllowFrom` config (similar to groups)
3. Route to session like `agent:<agentId>:telegram:channel:<chatId>`

## Environment
- OpenClaw: 2026.1.30
- Channel ID: -1001397847758 (@areyouhackingson)
- Bot added as admin with post/read permissions
