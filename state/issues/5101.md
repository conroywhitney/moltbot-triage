I am sorry, but not...

The issue should be explained instead of ignored... I am not inventing what I get!

I wish I could be informed if what I am doing is the seing way... I am eun'ing it for the first time so I runned the interactive onboarding first but I failed to Find the image Locally, and when I tried to pull it, it failed too...

Thank you

which hardware are you using? 

### @EthanThePhoenix38 (2026-01-31)

Mac Studio M3 Ultra with latest OS (MacOS Tahoe), which is more than efficient 😂

`docker pull ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw`
