## Description

## Problem

When an exec command triggers approval, the full raw command is forwarded to the user (e.g., via Discord DM). For complex commands like multi-line curl calls with JSON bodies, this creates a wall of text that's hard to parse quickly.

## Example

A Notion API curl call with a JSON body resulted in an approval message that was ~15 lines of raw shell — way too much to read on a phone or in a Discord DM.

## Suggestion

Summarize the approval message instead of showing the raw command. For example:

**Current:**
```
NOTION_KEY=$(cat ~/.config/notion/api_key) && curl -s -X POST "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages" -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_KEY" ...
```

**Proposed:**
```
🔒 curl POST to api.notion.com (create Notion page)
Full command: [expandable/truncated]
```

Options could include:
- Truncate to first N characters with a "show full" option
- Show just the binary name + a short summary
- Config option for max approval message length
- Parse common commands (curl, git, etc.) into human-readable summaries
