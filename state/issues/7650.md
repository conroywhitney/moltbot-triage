## Description

## Problem
The `buildTimeSection` function in the system prompt only included the timezone, not the actual date/time:

```
## Current Date & Time
Time zone: America/Los_Angeles
If you need the current date, time, or day of week, use the session_status tool.
```

This is confusing because:
1. The section is titled "Current Date & Time" but doesn't include either
2. Agents shouldn't need to make an extra tool call just to know what day it is

## Fix Applied
Updated `buildTimeSection` to generate the actual formatted date/time:

```
## Current Date & Time
Sunday, February 2, 2026, 6:47 PM (America/Los_Angeles)
```

## Trade-off
This does affect prompt cache stability (previously noted in commit 66eec29). However, having agents always know the current date/time without a tool call is more valuable than the cache hit rate improvement.
