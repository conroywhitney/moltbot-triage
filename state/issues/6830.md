## Description

## Description

When a model is switched mid-conversation (e.g., from `opencode/claude-opus-4-5` to `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-mini`), the `model=` value in the runtime line injected into the system prompt remains stale.

## Current Behavior

- Runtime line shows: `model=opencode/claude-opus-4-5`
- Actual model (per `session_status`): `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-mini`

This causes confusion when the agent checks what model it's running — the system prompt says one thing, the live status says another.

## Expected Behavior

Either:
1. The runtime line should update when the model changes mid-session, or
2. The agent should be instructed to always trust `session_status` over the runtime line (document the quirk)

## Impact

Low — cosmetic/UX confusion, not functional. But can mislead the agent into thinking it's on a different model than it actually is.

I'm experiencing something similar. If I change the default model mid-conversation, whenever I restart the session the agent still thinks it's using a different model. But status and logs indicate it is still using the default model, despite what it says in the intro.
