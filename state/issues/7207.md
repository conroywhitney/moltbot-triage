## Description

Summary

OpenClaw WhatsApp integration works correctly when using Google Gemini models, but when switching to OpenAI (ChatGPT) models, WhatsApp shows a “connection error” instead of delivering the reply. OpenClaw logs indicate that the message is received and an auto-reply is generated, but the response is not delivered to WhatsApp.

What went wrong?

## Steps to reproduce

Install and set up OpenClaw (v2026.1.30) on Windows.

Enable and link the WhatsApp plugin (QR scan completes successfully).

Configure Google Gemini as the primary model and verify that WhatsApp replies work.

Switch the model provider to OpenAI (ChatGPT) and set it as the primary model.

Send a message to the bot from WhatsApp.
## Expected behavior

When a message is sent from WhatsApp, the bot should generate a response using the selected OpenAI (ChatGPT) model and deliver the reply back to WhatsApp, similar to the behavior observed with Google Gemini.

## Actual behavior

WhatsApp shows a “connection error” when the bot attempts to reply using OpenAI models.
OpenClaw logs show that the inbound message is received and an auto-reply is generated, but the message is not delivered to the WhatsApp client.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version:
- OS: Windows
