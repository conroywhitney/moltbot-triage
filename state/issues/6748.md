## Description

## Description
When uploading images in the Control UI chat, WebSocket event sequence gaps occur, causing the image to not be received by the agent despite appearing in the UI.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Control UI chat
2. Upload an image with a text message
3. Observe "event gap detected (expected seq X, got X+1); refresh recommended" warning

## Expected Behavior
Image should be received and processed by the agent.

## Actual Behavior
- Image thumbnail displays in chat UI
- Agent responds "The image didn't come through on my end"
- Event gap warning appears

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
- Tested on both local network and via reverse proxy (Cloudflare tunnel)
- Issue occurs in both scenarios, ruling out network as root cause

## Additional Context
The gap is always exactly 1 event, suggesting an event is being dropped during image processing rather than network packet loss.
