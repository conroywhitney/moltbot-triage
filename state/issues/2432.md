## Description

## Summary
When setting bind mounts via "docker.bind", the read tool cannot read them.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Configure sandbox with mode: all and a bind mount
2. Ask the agent to read from that path

## Expected behavior
It should be able to read  from the bind mount

## Actual behavior
Agent says it can't, it is sandboxed to the workspace

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.23
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): Nix
```
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "all",
        "workspaceAccess": "rw",
        "scope": "session",
        "docker": {
          "readOnlyRoot": false,
          "user": "0:0",
          "image": "clawdbot-sandbox",
          "binds": [
            "/home/filip/Repos:/repos:rw",
            "/home/filip/obsidian-vault:/vault:rw"
          ]
        }
      },
```

### @kesslerio (2026-01-29)

hitting the same issue with skills loaded via `extraDirs`

my setup:
- work agent with `sandbox.mode: "all"`, `workspaceAccess: "ro"`
- skills in `~/shapescale-moltbot-skills/` loaded via `skills.load.extraDirs`
- added the path to `docker.binds`: `"/home/art/shapescale-moltbot-skills:/home/art/shapescale-moltbot-skills:ro"`

when the agent tries to read a skill's SKILL.md for context:
```
[tools] read failed: Path escapes sandbox root (~/.clawdbot/sandboxes/agent-work-xxx): /home/art/shapescale-moltbot-skills/calendly/SKILL.md
```

the bind is there but host-side path validation rejects it before docker ever sees the request. same story with paths inside the workspace that go through symlinks.

workaround for now: `sandbox.mode: "off"` for agents that need skill access

would be great if paths in `docker.binds` were auto-whitelisted for read validation, or if `extraDirs` paths got special treatment for sandboxed agents since the gateway already knows about them.
