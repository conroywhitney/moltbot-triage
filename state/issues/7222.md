## Description

### Summary
OpenClaw becomes completely unresponsive when session files lock. The agent receives incoming messages but cannot produce any output. Recovery requires external intervention (manual unlock/reset). This is a showstopper for any production use.

### Environment
- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 24.6.0, arm64)
- **Node:** v25.5.0
- **Model:** `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`
- **Channel:** WhatsApp (via gateway), webchat

### Symptoms
1. Messages arrive at the agent (visible in logs)
2. No response is sent back — complete silence
3. Agent is effectively dead but process appears running
4. No self-recovery possible — agent cannot detect or fix the lock
5. Requires external reset to restore functionality

### Frequency
**At least 7 times in a single morning (2026-02-02).** Each occurrence required manual intervention to restore functionality. Unclear trigger — may be related to session file writes during high activity or concurrent access.

### Impact
- **Severity:** Critical / Showstopper
- **User experience:** Agent goes dark without warning. Users have no indication anything is wrong until they notice the silence.
- **Workaround:** Manual intervention required (session reset, file unlock, or gateway restart)

### Expected Behavior
- Session file operations should not deadlock
- If a lock occurs, there should be timeout/recovery logic
- Agent should be able to self-heal or at minimum alert about the locked state

### Possible Investigation Areas
- File locking mechanism for session storage
- Concurrent write handling
- Timeout/retry logic for file operations
- Watchdog or health-check that could detect locked state

## Steps to Reproduce
(Exact trigger unknown — intermittent)
1. Run OpenClaw with Claude Opus 4.5 as default model
2. Use WhatsApp gateway with normal message flow
3. At some point, session files lock
4. Agent stops responding entirely

## Additional Context
This has occurred multiple times in a production setup. User is running OpenClaw as a primary assistant and the lockups cause significant disruption. Happy to provide logs or additional diagnostics if helpful.
