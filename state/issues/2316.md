## Description

## Summary
Add support for per-channel `responsePrefix` configuration, allowing different prefixes (or no prefix) for different channels.

## Use Case
User wants a prefix (e.g., 🦇) on WhatsApp group messages to distinguish bot responses from their own messages, but doesn't want/need the prefix on Discord or DMs.

## Current Behavior
`messages.responsePrefix` is global and applies to all outbound messages across all channels.

## Proposed Behavior
Allow `responsePrefix` to be set per-channel:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      responsePrefix: "🦇"
    },
    discord: {
      responsePrefix: null  // or omit for no prefix
    }
  }
}
```

Could also support per-context (DM vs group) within a channel:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      dm: { responsePrefix: null },
      groups: { "*": { responsePrefix: "🦇" } }
    }
  }
}
```

## Additional Context
- Global `messages.responsePrefix` should remain as the fallback default
- Per-channel setting would override the global
- Per-group/DM setting would override per-channel
