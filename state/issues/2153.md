## Description

Hello,

I am running Clawdbot in a network environment that requires a proxy to connect to WhatsApp's servers.

When trying to connect, the QR code generation fails with the following timeout error:

<text> Waiting for WhatsApp connection... WhatsApp Web connection ended before fully opening. status=408 Request Time-out WebSocket Error (Opening handshake has timed out) WhatsApp login failed: Error: status=408 Request Time-out WebSocket Error (Opening handshake has timed out) I have tried setting the standard HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, but they do not seem to be used by the WhatsApp (Baileys) connection.
Since the Baileys library supports proxy configuration via a custom agent in the makeWASocket config, could you please expose an option in clawdbot.json to specify a proxy URL (e.g., http://user:pass @host:port)?

This would allow users in restricted network environments to use the WhatsApp integration.

Thank you!

for web/session.js file:
```
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from "https-proxy-agent";
```
in createWaSocket function, add:
```
    const proxyUrl = process.env.HTTPS_PROXY || process.env.https_proxy || process.env.HTTP_PROXY || process.env.http_proxy;
    const agent = proxyUrl ? new HttpsProxyAgent(proxyUrl) : undefined;
```

in makeWASocket function add agent variable in it
