## Description

Hi team,

First of all, thank you for creating and maintaining this project. I've been experimenting with a self-hosted Docker setup with local Ollama, and I appreciate the work that's gone into this.

However, I'm confused and concerned about the current npm package situation. I did some research and would like to share my findings and ask for clarification.

## What I checked (step by step)

I ran these commands on January 28, 2026. Anyone can reproduce these steps.

### Step 1: Who OWNS the package now?

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/moltbot" | jq '.maintainers'
```

**Result:**
```json
[{ "name": "steipete", "email": "steipete@gmail.com" }]
```

**What this means:** The `maintainers` field shows who can manage the package on npm. This is Peter Steinberger (the project creator). **Good news: the official team now owns the package.**

---

### Step 2: What happens when someone runs `npm install moltbot`?

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/moltbot" | jq '."dist-tags"'
```

**Result:**
```json
{ "latest": "0.1.0", "beta": "2026.1.27-beta.1" }
```

**What this means:**
- `dist-tags` are labels that point to specific versions
- `latest` is what you get when you run `npm install moltbot` (without specifying a version)
- Currently, `latest` points to version `0.1.0`

---

### Step 3: Who uploaded version 0.1.0?

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/moltbot/0.1.0" | jq '{version, _npmUser, size: .dist.unpackedSize}'
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "_npmUser": { "name": "consistent_lee", "email": "consistent_lee@163.com" },
  "size": 283
}
```

**What this means:**
- `_npmUser` shows who uploaded this specific version
- `consistent_lee` is **NOT** Peter Steinberger - this appears to be the original squatter
- The package is only **283 bytes** - a real npm package is typically megabytes

---

### Step 4: Who uploaded the beta version?

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/moltbot/2026.1.27-beta.1" | jq '{version, _npmUser, size: .dist.unpackedSize}'
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "version": "2026.1.27-beta.1",
  "_npmUser": { "name": "steipete", "email": "steipete@gmail.com" },
  "size": 41716065
}
```

**What this means:**
- This version was uploaded by Peter (the real maintainer)
- It's **41 MB** - this is the actual project code

---

## Summary of findings

| What I checked | Result | Status |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Package ownership | `steipete@gmail.com` | ✅ Official team has control |
| `@latest` version (0.1.0) | Uploaded by `consistent_lee`, 283 bytes | ⚠️ Squatter's dummy package |
| `@beta` version | Uploaded by `steipete`, 41 MB | ✅ Real project code |

**The problem:**
- The README says: `npm install -g moltbot@latest`
- But `@latest` still points to the squatter's 283-byte dummy package
- Users following the official instructions get the wrong package

---

## Why I'm concerned

1. **Issue #2775 was closed** with a comment "we've had control over it for a bit now" - but the `@latest` tag still points to 0.1.0?

2. **The fix seems simple:** Since the team now owns the package, publishing a new version (e.g., `npm publish`) would automatically make it the new `@latest`. Why hasn't this happened?

3. **The README hasn't been updated** to point users to `@beta` or `clawdbot@latest` in the meantime.

---

## My questions

1. **Is `moltbot@latest` (0.1.0) harmful?** Or is it just an empty placeholder?

2. **Is there a reason a new version hasn't been published** to claim the `@latest` tag?

3. **Should the README be updated** to `moltbot@beta` or `clawdbot@latest` until this is resolved?

4. **What's the recommended safe installation method right now?**

---

## My situation

I'm building from source using Docker, so I'm not directly affected. But I'm hesitant to recommend this project to others until the npm situation is clear.

I'm asking in good faith - I want to continue using this project, but I need to understand the security posture. If my concerns are unfounded, I'd appreciate clarification.

Thank you for your time.

**Environment:**
- Building from source (Docker)
- Not using `npm install -g`
- Verified on: January 28, 2026

● Let me show you the direct evidence:

● Bash(echo "=== moltbot@latest (default) ===" && npm view moltbot@latest version maintainers unpackedSize && echo "" && echo "===
      moltbot@beta ===" && npm view moltbo…)
  ⎿  === moltbot@latest (default) ===
     version = '0.1.0'
     maintainers = 'consistent_lee <consistent_lee@163.com>'
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(echo "=== Size comparison ===" && npm view moltbot@latest dist.unpackedSize && npm view moltbot@beta dist.unpackedSize)
  ⎿  === Size comparison ===
     283
     41716065

● Here's the proof directly from npm:

  moltbot@latest (what npm install -g moltbot installs)

  - Version: 0.1.0
  - Maintainer: consistent_lee@163.com
  - Size: 283 bytes ← just a placeholder

  moltbot@beta (official release)

  - Version: 2026.1.27-beta.1
  - Maintainer: steipete@gmail.com (official)
  - Size: 41,716,065 bytes (41 MB) ← real software

  ---
  283 bytes vs 41 MB - The @latest tag is clearly pointing to a fake placeholder package, not the real software.

  So if you run:
  - npm install -g moltbot → you get 283 bytes of nothing
  - npm install -g moltbot@beta → you get the real 41MB software

### @khadija-kallamu (2026-01-28)

Thanks for the explanation above, it really helped clear things up.

From a new user’s point of view, I followed the README and assumed `@latest` would install the correct version, so the behavior was quite confusing at first.

It might help to add a short note in the README (for example, recommending `npm install -g moltbot@beta` for now or warning about `@latest`) so first-time users don’t run into the same confusion.
