## Description

## Summary
When the LLM API returns an error (e.g., Anthropic 500), the gateway currently DMs the user with the error message. It would be useful to have a config option to route these errors to a designated channel instead.

## Use Case
I have a Discord setup with dedicated channels for different purposes:
- `📬bee-logs` - System events & activity logs
- `📬morning-buzz` - Daily reports
- etc.

Error messages like `LLM error api_error: Internal server error` would fit better in the logs channel than cluttering DMs, especially for transient API errors that resolve themselves.

## Proposed Solution
Add a config option like:
```json
{
  "messages": {
    "errorChannel": {
      "channel": "discord",
      "target": "1465928517949853830"
    }
  }
}
```

Or perhaps at the agent/channel level for more flexibility.

## Context
- Running Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- Discord channel with allowlisted guild
- Error occurred during heartbeat cycle (transient Anthropic API 500)
