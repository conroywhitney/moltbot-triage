## Description

## Summary
Currently there’s the copilot proxy to help with copilot models. This is (imo) a hacky solution and not intended(?) to be used like that. GitHub released the copilot sdk to build agents (https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk), is it maybe worth to migrate/add to the project?

## Proposed solution
Migrate to the sdk
