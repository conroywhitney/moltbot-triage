## Description

## Summary

When a new session is created for a Slack thread, the session starts with no context of previous messages in that thread. This breaks conversation continuity.

**Current flow:**
1. User mentions bot in channel → channel session
2. Bot replies in thread (due to `replyToMode: "all"`)
3. User replies in thread → new thread session (no context of bot's previous reply)

## Proposed solution

When creating a new session for a Slack thread:
1. Call Slack API (`conversations.replies`) to fetch existing thread messages
2. Inject those messages into the session context as prior conversation history

This preserves conversation continuity in threads.

## Alternatives considered

- `thread.inheritParent: true` — inherits entire parent channel history, not just the thread (too broad, high token usage)

## Additional context

**Config:**
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "replyToMode": "all",
      "thread": { "inheritParent": false }
    }
  }
}
```

**Related issues:**
- #4424 - thread routing (different: where replies go)
- #4380 - thread_ts type (different: lost thread IDs)
