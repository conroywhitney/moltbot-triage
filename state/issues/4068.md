## Description

## Summary

The Signal channel adapter lowercases group IDs before passing them to signal-cli. Since Signal group IDs are base64-encoded (case-sensitive), this breaks sending messages to groups.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Signal group (group ID will have mixed case, e.g., `mb+09B3md7Tnu0/bLVJaOJUxtc/Zig83EwXvh3zmu3w=`)
2. Try to send a message using the message tool:
   ```
   message(action=send, channel=signal, target="group:mb+09B3md7Tnu0/bLVJaOJUxtc/Zig83EwXvh3zmu3w=", message="test")
   ```
3. Error: `Signal RPC -1: Group not found: mb+09b3md7tnu0/blvjaojuxtc/zig83ewxvh3zmu3w=`

Note the group ID in the error is all lowercase.

## Expected Behavior

Group ID should be passed to signal-cli with original case preserved.

## Actual Behavior

Group ID is lowercased somewhere in the Signal adapter chain, causing signal-cli to fail to find the group.

## Observations

- Session `deliveryContext.to` stores the correct case
- Session key and `groupId` field are lowercased
- The lowercasing appears to happen when the message tool calls the Signal adapter

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- signal-cli 0.13.23

## Workaround

None currently. Cannot send messages to Signal groups via the message tool.

This is fixed in this PR and addresses the break in `normalizeSignalMessagingTarget()`: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/5618 

### @ajGulati05 (2026-02-02)

@arjunblj  @Zundrium @buildzerobob  - I tested this thoroughly assuming the issue was the base group ID. It is not.

The behavior is driven by two things:

1. The content of the messages in the Signal group chat.

2. The activation prompt defined [here](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/411d5fda587c5ae44735550f9a23fe224de5da9f/src/auto-reply/reply/groups.ts#L93-L95): 

The bot only responds to messages it determines are worth answering based on that prompt. Separately, Signal does not support identifying mentions. As a result, the bot is effectively always “active” in Signal groups. This differs from Telegram, where:

1. The bot can react to simple messages like “test” if it is explicitly tagged.

2. You can configure it to always reply, whether or not it is mentioned but then it will follow how signal works. 

The current GROUP message behavior appears intentional, likely to avoid wasting tokens by responding to every group message.

An idea would be to make this behavior configurable per deployment or default to this behaviour
