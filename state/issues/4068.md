## Description

## Summary

The Signal channel adapter lowercases group IDs before passing them to signal-cli. Since Signal group IDs are base64-encoded (case-sensitive), this breaks sending messages to groups.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Signal group (group ID will have mixed case, e.g., `mb+09B3md7Tnu0/bLVJaOJUxtc/Zig83EwXvh3zmu3w=`)
2. Try to send a message using the message tool:
   ```
   message(action=send, channel=signal, target="group:mb+09B3md7Tnu0/bLVJaOJUxtc/Zig83EwXvh3zmu3w=", message="test")
   ```
3. Error: `Signal RPC -1: Group not found: mb+09b3md7tnu0/blvjaojuxtc/zig83ewxvh3zmu3w=`

Note the group ID in the error is all lowercase.

## Expected Behavior

Group ID should be passed to signal-cli with original case preserved.

## Actual Behavior

Group ID is lowercased somewhere in the Signal adapter chain, causing signal-cli to fail to find the group.

## Observations

- Session `deliveryContext.to` stores the correct case
- Session key and `groupId` field are lowercased
- The lowercasing appears to happen when the message tool calls the Signal adapter

## Environment

- Clawdbot 2026.1.24-3
- signal-cli 0.13.23

## Workaround

None currently. Cannot send messages to Signal groups via the message tool.
