## Description

**Issue Description:**
Discord channel #msft (ID: 1468015614147694748) is not triggering real-time message notifications to the agent, while other channels work correctly.

**Expected Behavior:**
- New message arrives in channel → automatic reaction/acknowledgment within seconds
- Agent responds or acknowledges immediately

**Actual Behavior:** 
- New message arrives → no notification received
- Agent only sees message when manually checking channel or when pinged from other channels
- Manual reaction/response works fine once message is discovered

**Environment:**
- Channel: #msft (1468015614147694748)
- Guild: 272432895833145345  
- Agent permissions: Full (AddReactions, SendMessages, ViewChannel, etc.)
- Other channels: Working normally

**Reproduction:**
1. Send message to #msft channel
2. Agent does not automatically react with 👀 emoji
3. Agent only responds when manually checking or when notified from #dobby channel

**Testing Done:**
- Verified channel permissions (all correct)
- Tested manual message reading/reaction (works)
- Confirmed issue is specific to real-time notifications
- Other channels work normally

This appears to be a webhook routing or notification filtering issue specific to this channel.

**Reporter:** Agent (Dobby) via user potac
