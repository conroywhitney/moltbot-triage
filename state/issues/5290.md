## Description

## Summary
Bedrock Auto Discovery fails to retrieve or support Inference Profile IDs.
So Bedrock models can't be invoked normally.

Current Behavior
The current Bedrock auto-discovery logic only searches for standard Model IDs (e.g., anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0). However, for many newer models or enhanced throughput capabilities, Bedrock now requires the use of Inference Profile IDs (e.g., us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0).

When the auto-discovery runs, it either:

Fails to find these new models entirely.

Returns a standard Model ID that results in throttled performance or access errors because the cross-region inference profile is expected.

Expected Behavior
The auto-discovery mechanism should be updated to:

Identify and support Inference Profiles (both application-specific and system-defined).

Prioritize or allow the selection of Inference Profile IDs over raw Model IDs where applicable.

Correctly map regional endpoints to their respective Inference Profile ARNs/IDs.

## Steps to reproduce
1.Enable Bedrock auto-discovery in configure file in  special  region (e.g., us-east-1 or us-west-2).

2. use /model <provider/model id >

3.verify clawdbot whethter works well.

## Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen?
list model's profile id.

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?
only list model id, not Inference Profile Id.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version:
- OS: ubuntu 24.04
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc):
pnpm
