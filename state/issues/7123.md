## Description

## Summary

Right now, Telegram can only stream messages in threaded DM's using `sendMessageDraft`.

## Proposed solution

Continously edit the message (while respecting rate limits) so stream the response back.

## Alternatives considered

Stick to `sendMessageDraft` and wait for an official non-DM and non-threaded DM approach.

## Comments

### @rursache (2026-02-02)

would love to see this one in openclaw!

this also won't require converting the bot to use threads (which i personally don't like)

### @barryvdh (2026-02-02)

Same as https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/1876 which was closed because inactive, so I'll add comment here:

- Example repo doing this: https://github.com/grammyjs/stream
- Telegram docs for editing: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#editmessagetext
- Rate limits suggest max 1 message per second: https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this
