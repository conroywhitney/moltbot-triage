## Description

## Summary
Unable to log in to ClawdHub via CLI — always returns `Unauthorized`. This blocks any ClawdHub-related actions.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Install / open the CLI.
2. Run: `clawhub login`
3. Provide the ClawdHub API token when prompted (or set it via environment/config if applicable).
4. Observe the response.

## Expected behavior
Login should succeed and the CLI should authenticate successfully, allowing access to ClawdHub features (e.g., listing workspaces/projects, syncing, etc.).

## Actual behavior
Login fails consistently with `Unauthorized`. No actions requiring authentication can proceed.

## Environment
- Clawdbot/ClawdHub CLI version: `<paste version output here>`
- OS: `<e.g., Windows 11 / macOS 14 / Ubuntu 24.04>`
- Install method: `<pnpm / npx / brew / docker / installer>`
- Node.js version (if relevant): `<node -v>`
- Shell/Terminal (optional): `<bash/zsh/powershell>`

I am running openclaw and clawhub on WSL and also receiving this same error. I set 'export BROWSER=none' to prevent browser opening errors. Then I do 'clawhub login' and manually open the login link. I am already signed into Clawhub so I get a redirect with the displayed text stating 'Completing login… Logged in. You can close this tab.'

Immediately after this I get console output '✖ Unauthorized Error: Unauthorized'

Using 'clawhub login --no-browser --token <token>' or 'clawhub login --token <token>' results in the same error '✖ Unauthorized Error: Unauthorized'

Related to https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/4623. Fixed here https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.ai/pull/28. Workaround is to force registry `clawhub.ai`.

Please advise if there's anything I'm missing. I'm still having the same issue. It attempts to open a firefox window as well as my default browser however I think the firefox instance it is using is a part of my playwright/camoufox install. As well this instance doesn't have connectivity to localhost?

Don't worry about the revealed token, its already been revoked. Thanks.

Looks like you are login with a remote machine. You need to tunnel your remote port to localhost:
```
ssh -L 32777:localhost:32777 user@remote_device_ip
```

Once finished, you can see a similar result to https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/5366#issuecomment-3830934505 mentioned.

I came to this issue because I cannot login to the clawdhub.ai, too. And, the pull request is not merged now.
