## Description

## Problem

When the agent sends messages with markdown formatting (bold, headers, lists) to channels that don't render markdown (like iMessage), it looks ugly with raw asterisks and hashes showing.

Example of what happens:
```
**ALPHAGENOME**
AI-modell som förstår DNAs "mörka materia"...
```

Shows literally as `**ALPHAGENOME**` instead of being stripped or converted.

## Suggested Solution

Auto-strip or convert markdown when sending to channels that don't support it:

- **iMessage/SMS**: Strip `**bold**` → `bold`, `## headers` → `HEADERS` or just text, `- list items` → `• list items` or plain text
- **Discord/Telegram/Slack**: Keep markdown as-is (they render it)

Could be a per-channel config option like:
```yaml
imessage:
  stripMarkdown: true
  # or
  markdownSupport: false
```

## Alternatives

1. Agent instructions to never use markdown for certain channels (current workaround, error-prone)
2. Post-processing in the message plugin before sending

## Additional Context

This would make multi-channel setups much smoother - the agent can write naturally with formatting and have it automatically adapted per channel.
