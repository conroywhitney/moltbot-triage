### @huahuayu (2026-02-01)

The same, after the upgrade to v2026.1.30 Antigravity model returns this. Because the version in clawdbot/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-ai/dist/providers/google-gemini-cli.js is hardcode

### @huahuayu (2026-02-01)

**Workaround**: This issue is caused by a hardcoded outdated User-Agent version (`1.15.8`) in the `@mariozechner/pi-ai` dependency.

Until it's fixed upstream, you can manually patch the file:

```bash
# Find and replace the outdated version
sed -i 's/antigravity\/1.15.8/antigravity\/1.15.9/g' $(npm root)/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-ai/dist/providers/google-gemini-cli.js

# Or if using pnpm, find the correct path first:
grep -r "antigravity/1.15.8" $(npm root) 2>/dev/null

# Restart your service after patching
```

I've reported this upstream at https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1129

If you're on macOS try installing the macOS app. Running it's startup wizard resolved the issues for me.
