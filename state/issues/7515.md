## Description

## Description
The `message` tool fails to send messages via Telegram with "Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!" error, while direct API calls via curl work perfectly.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure Telegram plugin with valid bot token
2. Add user to allowlist
3. Receive messages from Telegram (works)
4. Try to send via message tool:
```
message action=send channel=telegram target=<chat_id> message="test"
```
5. Observe error: "Network request for 'sendMessage' failed!"

## Expected Behavior
Message should be sent successfully.

## Actual Behavior
Returns network error, but direct curl to Telegram API works:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat_id": <id>, "text": "test"}'
# Returns {"ok":true,...}
```

## Environment
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.1
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-94-generic (x64)
- Node: v22.22.0

## Workaround
Using exec+curl to send messages directly works as a temporary workaround.

## Additional Context
- Receiving Telegram messages works fine
- Issue persists after gateway restart
- Direct API calls prove the bot token and chat_id are valid
