## Description


Subject: Webchat "Silent" Issue: Connected but No Response (Deep Diagnosis inside)

System Info:

OS: macOS Sequoia (26.2) - Mac Mini
Node.js: v22+ (using undici)
Installation: Multiple methods tested (Source, Global, Installer)
The Problem:
Webchat UI shows "Connected," but messages receive no reply. Based on my analysis, I suspect the issue lies in one of the following three areas:

Ghost WebSocket Connection: Despite the "connected" status, message frames might be intercepted by macOS Sequoia's enhanced local network isolation/firewall, potentially due to IPv4/IPv6 resolution mismatch between the Gateway and the Frontend.
undici Network Conflicts: Node 22’s undici engine might be silently hanging during the SSE (Server-Sent Events) handshake or failing due to TLS fingerprinting/TTFB timeouts in a proxied environment, even if curl works fine.
Internal Hook Deadlock: Possible deadlock in session-memory or other internal plugins. If the initial sub-request (e.g., for session naming) hits a 15s timeout due to latency, it might be locking the main Agent process entirely.
Question:
How can I bypass the undici fetch constraints or force the WebSocket to use a specific IP stack (IPv4 only) in OpenClaw? Is there a way to disable pre-hooks to test if it's a plugin deadlock?
