## Description

## Environment
- **OpenClaw version:** 2026.1.29
- **Browser:** Chrome (latest)
- **OS:** macOS
- **Channel:** Webchat (Control UI)

## Description
When using the Webchat interface in Chrome, messages from the assistant sometimes don't appear in the chat window. The user can see their own sent messages, but the assistant's responses are occasionally missing from the display.

## Behavior
- User sends a message → message appears
- Assistant responds → response sometimes doesn't appear
- The responses ARE being processed (confirmed via Telegram, which works correctly)
- Issue is specific to Webchat; Telegram channel displays all messages correctly

## Expected Behavior
All assistant messages should be displayed in the Webchat interface.

## Possible Causes
- WebSocket message handling
- Auto-scroll not triggering
- DOM update race condition
- Message rendering timing issue

## Workaround
Using Telegram instead of Webchat shows all messages correctly.
