## Description

## Summary

When a model request fails (e.g., invalid API key, rate limit, auth error, unsupported model), neither the TUI nor webchat displays the actual error message.

## Observed Behavior

- **TUI:** Shows "(no output)" after the request completes
- **Webchat:** Shows a blank/empty message

## Expected Behavior

The error message should be displayed inline so users can troubleshoot (e.g., "401 Unauthorized", "model not found", "rate limit exceeded").

## Reproduction Steps

1. Configure a model with an invalid or missing API key
2. Switch to that model in TUI or webchat
3. Send a message
4. Observe blank response instead of error details

## Workaround

Tail logs in a separate terminal:
```bash
clawdbot logs --follow
# or
tail -f /tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-*.log | grep -i error
```

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Interfaces affected: TUI, Webchat

Same issue here.

But I can occasionally receive responses, I'm unable to identify the root cause. In most cases, there is no output at all, while valid output shows up only with a very low probability.

Additionally, no error logs are found when checking via clawdbot logs --follow and in the log files at /tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-*.log, and I suspect this might be related to network issues.

When using the tui I've also found that when I get a (no output) response if I just escape out of the tui and immediately launch it again that (no output) turns into the actual error like a HTTP 400 message with a helpful error description.

I have uninsalled the clawdbot version and reinstall the openclaw version, also re-configed all settings. It works rn.

**I fixed my issue, even though it was a really silly one on my part.**

**Problem Description:**
The Clawdbot agent experiences severe communication instability during user interactions, with **almost 99% of responses resulting in no output**. Occasionally, a reply to a previous interaction might come through, but overall communication is highly unreliable. Backend logs (discovered in `.jsonl` files) frequently show a `TypeError: fetch failed sending request` error.

**Environment:**
*   Clawdbot Version: `2026.1.24-3` (885167d)
*   Model in Use: `google/gemini-2.5-flash`
*   Host OS: Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2 (x64)
*   WSL2 Distribution: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
*   Node.js Version: v22.22.0
*   **Network Environment:** Using `Clash for Windows` with `TUN Mode` enabled for VPN connection.

**Reproduction Steps (if applicable):**
1.  Initiate a conversation with Clawdbot.
2.  Observe that Clawdbot's responses are almost always empty or severely delayed, with very infrequent successful replies.

**Detailed Diagnosis Process and Findings:**

1.  **Log Investigation:**
    *   Initially attempted to check for error logs using `clawdbot logs --follow` and `tail -f /tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-*.log | grep -i error`, but **no relevant errors were found**.
    *   Subsequently, investigated the session record files (`*.jsonl`) located in the `.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/` directory.
    *   Found entries for responses with no output in the `*.jsonl` files, which contained the following error message:
        ```json
        {"type":"message","id":"9aca9159","parentId":"39b14960","timestamp":"2026-01-30T06:57:59.427Z","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[],"api":"google-generative-ai","provider":"google","model":"gemini-2.5-flash","usage":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":0,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"error","timestamp":1769756269413,"errorMessage":"exception TypeError: fetch failed sending request"}}
        ```
    *   The specific error `errorMessage: "exception TypeError: fetch failed sending request"` was confirmed.

2.  **Network Proxy and API Reachability Test:**
    *   Given the error message, suspected a network or proxy issue.
    *   Attempted to directly test if the Google Gemini API domain was reachable and resolvable by executing a `curl` command:
        ```bash
        curl -v "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"test"}]}]}'
        ```
    *   The `curl` command returned the error: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, clearly indicating a domain name resolution failure.

3.  **DNS Configuration Check and Fix:**
    *   Checked the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on the WSL2 host.
    *   Discovered that the previously added `nameserver 8.8.8.8` entry was missing.
    *   Re-added `nameserver 8.8.8.8` to `/etc/resolv.conf`.
    *   After re-testing Clawdbot and the `curl` command, the issue was resolved, and communication returned to normal.

**Root Cause:**
The `/etc/resolv.conf` file in the WSL2 environment where Clawdbot is running was not correctly configured with DNS servers (specifically, the `nameserver 8.8.8.8` entry was missing). This prevented the system from resolving the Google Gemini API domain `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, leading to the `TypeError: fetch failed sending request` error and a near-complete communication breakdown.

This issue is exacerbated by the fact that WSL2's network configuration, influenced by the host's network environment (including `Clash for Windows` in TUN mode) or WSL2 restarts, can automatically update or reset `/etc/resolv.conf`, causing manually added DNS entries to be lost.

**Proposed Solution:**
In the WSL2 environment (Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS) where Clawdbot is running, edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to include one or more reliable DNS server addresses, for example:
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```
(Or configure with appropriate DNS servers based on your network environment).
