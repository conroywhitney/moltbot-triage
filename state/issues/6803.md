## Description

Summary

What went wrong?

There are two major issues with cron scheduling in Clawdbot/OpenClaw:

Incorrect time calculation when generating reminders based on user input in UTC+8.

Incorrect channel handling, where tasks created from external channels (e.g., Feishu) default to system events instead of returning through the originating agent/channel.

Steps to reproduce

Set your local timezone to UTC+8 (Beijing time).

Ask the model to create a reminder a few minutes in the future (e.g., “remind me in 2 minutes”).

Send the request from a specific channel (e.g., Feishu).

Observe the scheduled time and the channel used for the system event.

Expected behavior

The model should correctly calculate timestamps based on the user’s local timezone (UTC+8).

Tasks created from a channel (e.g., Feishu) should default to returning through the same agent/channel, not system events.

Actual behavior

The model generates incorrect timestamps. For example:

Current time: 10:18 AM Beijing time.

Requested: reminder in 2 minutes.

Actual scheduled time: 3:21 PM Beijing time.

Tasks created from a channel always default to system events instead of the originating agent/channel.

Environment

Clawdbot version: 2026.1.30

OS: macOS

Install method: curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

Logs or screenshots

Paste relevant logs or add screenshots (redact secrets).

Additional investigation

I attempted the following:

Created a custom cron-skills file and added constraints to guide correct behavior — this had no effect.

Modified the cron-related description in AGENT.md to force the model to reference cron-skills — this also had no effect.

This raises a question:
Is this due to limitations in the model’s capability or prompt-following behavior? Why do changes to AGENT.md not take effect in this scenario?
