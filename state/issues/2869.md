## Description

## Summary
What went wrong?

After starting the gateway with docker compose up I get this error in the logging and the container restarts

`2026-01-27T16:45:16.387Z Missing config. Run `clawdbot setup` or set gateway.mode=local (or pass --allow-unconfigured).`

The .env CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_BIND is set and the env file is set in the docker-compose.yml

## Steps to reproduce
Follow the Hetzner documentation

## Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen?
The gateway starts without problems

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?
The gateway is in a loop of restarts

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.26
- OS: Linux 5.15.0-164-generic #174-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 14 20:25:16 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): docker

Same issue here with 2026.1.24, and using latest Dockerfile from main branch
`Linux 6.8.0-90-generic #91-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Nov 18 14:14:30 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
Install method: docker

### @musantro (2026-01-28)

I could make it work by creating the file `${CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_DIR}/moltbot.json`: 
```json5
{
  gateway: {
    mode: "local",
    }
}
```

### @Ph0xEn (2026-01-28)

Unfortunately, that doesn't work for me. I still get the same error message.
