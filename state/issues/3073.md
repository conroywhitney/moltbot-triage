## Description

## Description
Incoming audio messages from Telegram are not being transcribed automatically. The message arrives as `<media:audio>` without the transcript text.

## Expected behavior
Audio messages should include the transcript, e.g.:
```
[Telegram user] Transcribed text here
<media:audio>
```

## Actual behavior
Only `<media:audio>` is received, no transcript.

## Debugging done
- **Deepgram API works**: Manual curl request to Deepgram API with the same audio file returns correct transcript
- **Config is correct**:
```json
"media": {
  "audio": {
    "enabled": true,
    "language": "es",
    "models": [{
      "provider": "deepgram",
      "model": "nova-2",
      "language": "es",
      "deepgram": {
        "punctuate": true,
        "smartFormat": true
      },
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Token xxx"
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

## Environment
- Channel: Telegram
- Audio format: `.ogg` (opus codec)
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3

## Notes
This was working before. User reports no config changes were made to break it.
