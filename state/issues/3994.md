## Description

The Docker-packaged image does not include the `moltbot` command, so it cannot be executed directly inside the container. Instead, the command must be run via `/app/packages/clawdbot/node_modules/.bin/moltbot`.

## Comments

Hi! I’m working on reproducing this issue locally using the Dockerfile and will propose a fix if confirmed.

🔗 **Fix PR:** #4070 — `fix(docker): expose moltbot CLI in Docker image`

This PR directly addresses the missing \`moltbot\` command in Docker builds.
