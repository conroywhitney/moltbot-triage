## Description

### Problem

When the Discord bot takes a long time (>2 minutes) to process and respond to a message, the response sometimes never arrives in Discord, even though the bot successfully completed the action.

### Observed behavior

1. User sends message in Discord thread
2. Bot receives and processes message (confirmed via logs and session history)
3. Bot performs action (e.g., saves API key to config, restarts gateway)
4. Bot sends response — **but response never appears in Discord**

The user sees typing indicator for ~2 minutes, then nothing.

### Log evidence

```
Slow listener detected: discord message handler took 132061ms
```

### Environment

- Windows 11
- OpenClaw 2026.1.29
- Discord thread (child of private channel)
- Model: github-copilot/claude-opus-4.5

### Hypothesis

When the listener takes >2 minutes, the Discord WebSocket connection may time out or lose sync, causing outbound messages to be dropped silently. Discord's WebSocket has a heartbeat interval and may consider the connection stale.

### Workaround

Using webchat or parent channel for complex operations that might take >1 minute.

### Additional context

This may be related to earlier lane processing issues with Discord threads:
- Threads sometimes get stuck with messages in queue (`lane enqueue` without corresponding `lane dequeue`)
- `discord channels unresolved` warnings appear in logs for thread IDs
