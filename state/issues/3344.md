## Description

## Summary

When using Gemini models (tested with `gemini-3-pro-high` via `google-antigravity`), the model outputs text that *describes* a tool call instead of actually executing the tool. This results in users seeing raw tool call syntax in their chat.

## Observed Behavior

**Issue 1: Fake tool call output instead of execution**

The model outputs this text to the user instead of calling the `read` tool:

```
[Historical context: a different model called tool "read" with arguments: {
  "path": "/home/node/.clawdbot/media/inbound/<uuid>.md"
}. Do not mimic this format - use proper function calling.]
```

The `stopReason` in the session log is `"stop"` (not `"tool_use"`), confirming the tool was never called.

This happened 3 times consecutively in the same session.

**Issue 2: Wrong parameters for message tool**

The model also used a display name instead of the chat ID when trying to reply via Telegram:

```
[tools] message failed: Unknown target "Tony D" for Telegram. Hint: <chatId>
```

Expected: Model should use the chat ID from the incoming message context (e.g., `telegram:123456789`)
Actual: Model used the display name "Tony D"

## Expected Behavior

1. Model should execute the `read` tool via proper function calling, not output fake tool syntax as text
2. Model should use the correct chat ID from message context for replies

## Session Log Excerpts

```json
{"type":"message","id":"4c34ca8e","timestamp":"2026-01-28T13:00:46.662Z","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[Historical context: a different model called tool \"read\" with arguments: {\n  \"path\": \"/home/node/.clawdbot/media/inbound/<uuid>.md\"\n}. Do not mimic this format - use proper function calling.]"}],"api":"google-gemini-cli","provider":"google-antigravity","model":"gemini-3-pro-high","stopReason":"stop"}}
```

```
2026-01-28T13:25:11.317Z [tools] message failed: Unknown target "Tony D" for Telegram. Hint: <chatId>
```

## Environment

- Moltbot version: 2026.1.27-beta.1
- Model: `gemini-3-pro-high` via `google-antigravity` provider
- Channel: Telegram
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)

## Related Issues

- #1391 - Gemini outputs command text in chat (similar but tool *does* execute)
- #1789 - Gemini requires explicit tool call patterns
- #2215 - Gemini fails to manage CronJobs via Tool Use

This appears to be a more severe variant where the tool is never executed at all, just hallucinated as text output.

## Additional Issue: Gemini Pro silently hangs (no response, no error)

After switching to `gemini-3-pro-high`, the next user message caused the agent to hang indefinitely with no response and no error logged.

**Timeline:**
```
13:26:27 UTC - Model switched to gemini-3-pro-high
13:27:32 UTC - User message received ("Can you read .md files if I send one to you?")
13:27:32 UTC - [agent/embedded] google tool schema snapshot (processing started)
13:29:31 UTC - typing TTL reached (2m); stopping typing indicator
```

**Observations:**
- No error was logged
- No response was ever returned from the Gemini API
- Rate limits are NOT the issue (Gemini 3 Pro High shows 100% available with 167h remaining)
- The API call simply never completed

**Log excerpt:**
```
2026-01-28T13:27:32.174Z [agent/embedded] google tool schema snapshot
2026-01-28T13:29:31.866Z typing TTL reached (2m); stopping typing indicator
```

This appears to be a silent failure in the Gemini Pro API integration - the request was sent but no response (success or error) was ever received.

I have the same question, Is there a solution?
