## Description

## Summary
When users send messages in quick succession:
```text
User: wait
User: actually
User: use uv for that
```
These often get processed separately, so the bot responds to "wait" with "what?" before the user finishes. Annoying.

We naturally wait while someone is still talking. Messaging platforms have typing indicators - we could use them to know when to wait.

## Proposed solution
Wait for the user to stop typing before processing queued messages:
```json
{
  "messages": {
    "queue": {
      "watchTypingIndicator": true,
      "afterTypingStopMs": 1500
    }
  }
}
```

When enabled:
1. Message arrives, check if user is still typing
2. If typing, keep waiting
3. Typing stops, wait 1.5s, process all messages together

Falls back to normal debounce if typing indicators aren't available.

## Alternatives considered
- Keyword detection ("stop", "wait") - too language-specific for a global project
- Prefix signals (! or //) - requires users to learn new behavior
- Longer global debounce - slows down single-message interactions

## Related
- #4218 already tracks typing indicators for peer bot coordination (similar infra)
- #3052 proposes /stop command (complementary)

## Additional context
Platform support varies, Telegram and Discord have good typing events, WhatsApp and Signal are more limited.
Some edge cases to think about: users who disable typing indicators, group chats with multiple people typing, network delays.
