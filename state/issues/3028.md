## Description

## Problem
Clawdbot fails to start on Raspberry Pi (ARM) due to missing native binary for `@mariozechner/clipboard-linux-arm-gnueabihf`.

## Workaround
I've documented a patch that wraps the clipboard import in a try-catch, making it optional on ARM systems.

**Full guide with fix:** https://github.com/masterpaper/clawdbot-raspberry-pi-fix

Tested on Raspberry Pi 3B with Node.js v22.15.0.

Would be great if this could be handled upstream, or at least linked in the docs for ARM users!
