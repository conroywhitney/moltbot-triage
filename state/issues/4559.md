## Description

## Description

In a Telegram group (allowlisted, `requireMention: false`), messages from users other than the paired owner are **not received** by the bot at all. This includes:

- Regular messages from other group members
- Messages that **@mention the bot** directly
- Replies to the bot's own messages

Only the paired owner's messages are delivered to the group session.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Telegram group and add the bot
2. Configure the group in Clawdbot config:
   ```json
   "groups": {
     "-5048019472": {
       "requireMention": false,
       "enabled": true
     }
   }
   ```
3. Have another user (not the paired owner) send a message in the group
4. Even with @mention, the message does not appear in the group session history

## What was tried

- Set `requireMention: false` for the group
- Disabled Privacy Mode via BotFather (`/setprivacy` → Disable)
- Removed and re-added the bot to the group
- Gateway restart

None of these resolved the issue.

## Expected behavior

All messages in an allowlisted group should be received, regardless of which user sent them.

## Actual behavior

Only messages from the paired owner (DM-paired user) are received. Other group members' messages are silently dropped.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Channel: Telegram
- Group policy: allowlist
- DM policy: pairing
- OS: macOS (arm64)
- Node: v25.4.0
