Choosing manual setup.

Enter a local IP address for binding the service.

Installer later crashes with the message in the title.

## Comments

### @Amirchoudhary09 (2026-01-31)

It appears that the issue is in ClawDBot’s docker-setup.sh script.
During manual setup, the installer crashes after taking the local IP address as input.

The script may not be properly validating the user-provided IP address.
If the IP does not match any of the system’s network interfaces, the Docker bind fails and causes the script to crash.

Suggestions:

Validate the entered IP address using ip addr or hostname -I before proceeding

If the IP is invalid, show a proper error message instead of crashing the installer

Add some logging or debug output to help identify the exact point of failure

This would make the installer more robust and stable.

The installer is a mess currently.

The IP I entered is valid. I tried multiple times already.
