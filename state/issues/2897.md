## Description

Summary

When Moltbot doesn’t respond or behave as expected, users often don’t know why. Common causes include:

a messaging channel not authenticated or disconnected

missing or invalid API keys

skills being disabled or misconfigured

the gateway/agent not fully initialized

This leads to confusion during onboarding and repeated support questions in Discord and GitHub issues, requiring manual triage by maintainers.

There is currently no single, user-facing way to quickly diagnose these problems.

Proposed solution

Add a lightweight, read-only diagnostics command, for example:

moltbot doctor


The command would perform basic health checks and output a clear, human-readable status report, such as:

✔ Gateway running
✔ Agent initialized
✖ Telegram channel: not authenticated
✔ Discord channel: connected
✖ OpenAI API key missing
✔ Calendar skill enabled
✖ Email skill: authentication expired


Initial scope (V1):

Gateway / runtime status

Channel configuration & connection status (especially Telegram / WhatsApp)

Enabled skills

Missing required environment variables or credentials (without exposing secrets)

Goals:

Improve onboarding UX

Surface common setup and channel edge cases early

Reduce maintainer support and debugging overhead

No architectural changes or breaking behavior

Alternatives considered

Improving error messages only at failure points
→ Helps, but does not give users a holistic view of system health.

Adding more setup documentation
→ Useful, but static docs don’t help when something breaks dynamically.

Relying on logs alone
→ Logs are often too verbose or inaccessible for non-technical users.

A single diagnostics command provides a clearer and more actionable entry point.

Additional context

Aligns with current roadmap focus on UX improvements, onboarding, and stability of channel connections

Similar “doctor / diagnose” commands exist in other developer tools (e.g. Homebrew, Kubernetes) and are well understood by users

Happy to adjust naming or scope based on maintainer feedback before opening a PR
