## Description

## Summary

I ran the following command to install `openclaw` on a remote instance:

```
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

When asked to fill in the prompt after "Wake up, my friend!", typing or pasting anything in prints in the following:

```
◇  Install shell completion script?
│  No
```

This results in the shell freezing, effectively killing the shell.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install `openclaw` via the script
2. Run `openclaw onboard`
3. Reach the prompt after waking up the bot, and try typing/pasting something in.

## Expected behavior

I expected to be able to paste my response in.

## Actual behavior

The program froze, effectively crashing my shell.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: `2026.1.30 (76b5208)`
- OS: `Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-90-generic x86_64)`
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): `curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash`
- Terminal: ghostty

yeah it runs await runTui() but just returns immediately

I have the same issue. tried to install few times, doesn't help. 

### @cahya-wirawan (2026-02-01)

I think we get this issue if we run the installation remotely without graphical user interface. Because the installation try to run openclaw-gateway that use graphical user interface. There is no problem if I run directly with graphical UI.
