## Description

## Summary

Many settings are preserved because they write to `${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR}` and `${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR}` which are bind mounted to `/home/node/.openclaw` outside the docker. However, signal-cli writes to `~/.local/share/signal-cli` which is not a subdirectory of either of these. So, any registration data is lost if the container is ever deleted.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Add the signal channel and register a number.
2. Stop the docker container and delete it.
3. Start the docker again and observe that registration data is lost.

## Expected behavior

Registration should persist.

## Environment

- Clawdbot version: main (411d5fda5)
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): docker
