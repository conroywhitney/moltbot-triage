## Description

## Summary

Allow the local gateway to run independently of the app's connection mode. Currently, switching to "remote mode" stops the local gateway, but users may want both:

- **Client role**: App UI connects to a remote gateway (e.g., powerful server)
- **Server role**: Local gateway serves other clients (e.g., mobile devices, other machines)

## Current Behavior

- `gateway.mode` in `clawdbot.json` controls both the daemon startup AND the app's connection target
- Switching to remote mode in the app disables the local launchd job
- The daemon refuses to start unless `gateway.mode=local`

## Proposed Behavior

Decouple these two concepts:

1. **Daemon config** (`gateway.enabled` or similar): Should the local gateway run?
2. **App connection mode**: Which gateway(s) should the UI connect to?

This enables architectures like:

```
[Clawdbot App UI]
    ├── Local Gateway (localhost:18789) - serves mobile/other clients
    └── Remote Gateway (server:18789) - for heavy compute
```

## Implementation Ideas

- Remove `gateway.mode` check from daemon startup (or add `--allow-unconfigured` by default)
- Add separate `gateway.localEnabled` config for the daemon
- Allow app to maintain multiple gateway connections
- UI to switch "active" gateway without stopping others
