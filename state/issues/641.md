## Description

## Summary
OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent that supports 75+ LLM providers through a unified interface. Users who have already configured their provider in OpenCode should be able to use those same providers in Clawdbot without having to configure them separately. This would allow Clawdbot users to leverage any provider they've already set up in OpenCode, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Azure, Google Vertex AI, and many others.

## Proposed solution
Add OpenCode as a provider option in Clawdbot that:
1. Uses OpenCode's server mode (opencode serve) as a backend, which exposes an API that could be consumed by Clawdbot
2. Respects OpenCode's provider configuration from ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json or project-level opencode.json

## Alternatives considered
- Manually configuring each provider separately in Clawdbot (duplicates effort, harder to maintain)
- Using environment variables shared between both tools (less flexible, doesn't support all providers)

### @TheSethRose (2026-01-10)

I was looking into the effort for this and wanted to get clarification.
This is not a request to add Opencode Zen, but rather to use the opencode serve backend, correct?

### @waynehoover (2026-01-10)

Yes that's correct, the opencode serve backend. 

### @steipete (2026-01-10)

That defo is intresting, would love if someone can work on this.

### @thewilloftheshadow (2026-01-13)

OpenCode Zen provider + onboarding are implemented in main; see PRs https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/623 and https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/669 plus opencode provider code under src/agents/opencode-zen-models.ts.

### @johanohly (2026-01-26)

Hey, I think there's a misunderstanding here. This issue shouldn't be closed yet.

The request was specifically to support the opencode serve backend so users can bridge their existing configurations. Implementing OpenCode Zen is a different thing entirely and doesn't solve the problem of needing to re-configure all those providers manually in Clawdbot.

### @taqtiqa-mark (2026-01-29)

@thewilloftheshadow , I believe @johanohly is correct.

The PRs https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/pull/623 and https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/pull/669 both concern Zen.

@steipete could you clarify what you were endorsing:

- [ ] Implement Zen models
- [ ] Implement use of `opencode serve` aka `opencode` in solo mode
