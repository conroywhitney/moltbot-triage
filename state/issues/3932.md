## Description

## Summary

During fresh onboarding (`clawdbot onboard`), some skills appear to be enabled without explicit user consent. The user later had to manually disable them.

## Observed Behavior

After running `clawdbot onboard`, the following skills were found with `enabled: true` in `skills.entries`:
- bluebubbles
- notion
- slack
- tmux

The user did not explicitly enable these and had to disable them manually via config changes.

## Expected Behavior

Skills should default to `enabled: false` unless the user explicitly enables them during setup or configuration.

## Evidence

Gateway log shows sequential config changes as the user disabled them:
```
2026-01-29T11:06:14.321Z [reload] config change detected; evaluating reload (meta.lastTouchedAt, skills.entries)
2026-01-29T11:06:47.915Z [reload] config change detected; evaluating reload (meta.lastTouchedAt, skills.entries.bluebubbles)
2026-01-29T11:07:07.679Z [reload] config change detected; evaluating reload (meta.lastTouchedAt, skills.entries.notion)
2026-01-29T11:07:22.963Z [reload] config change detected; evaluating reload (meta.lastTouchedAt, skills.entries.slack)
2026-01-29T11:07:28.465Z [reload] config change detected; evaluating reload (meta.lastTouchedAt, skills.entries.tmux)
```

The config backups only show `enabled: false` (post-fix state), so the original enabled state was not preserved.

## Environment
Running on: Mac OS
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Onboarding ran at: 2026-01-29T08:41:55.573Z
- Mode: local

## Suggested Fix

Review the onboarding wizard logic to ensure skills default to disabled unless explicitly chosen by the user.
