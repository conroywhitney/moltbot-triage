Hey! I’m happy to take a stab at implementing this, but want to confirm a few details so I don’t build the wrong thing:

1) By "encrypted chat" do you mean Telegram *Secret Chats (E2E)* specifically, or normal cloud chats that bots can’t access well?
2) What’s the minimum must-work scenario (DM vs group vs channel vs forum topic), and is it inbound+outbound or outbound-only?
3) Should GramJS be an optional per-account mode (keep current Bot API support), or a replacement?
4) Are you OK with a user-login flow (phone/SMS + possible 2FA) and storing a persistent session (file or session string) on the gateway?

@roshanasingh4 there's no reason to ping maintainers, it just makes you look impatient and needy
