## Description

## Problem

The agent can send messages to Slack channels but has no record of those messages when operating in a DM session context. This creates a "blind spot" where the agent:
1. Sends messages to channels (e.g., #ai-agents)
2. Has no memory of sending them when asked in DMs
3. Cannot reference or follow up on its own channel conversations

## Current Behavior

**Scenario:**
1. Agent sends a message to `#ai-agents` channel
2. User asks agent (in DM): "Did you send a message to #ai-agents?"
3. Agent responds: "I have no record of sending any messages to channels"
4. User confirms the message exists in the channel

**What the agent sees:**
- Only messages in the current session context (DM)
- No visibility into other sessions (channels, threads)
- No record of messages sent via `message` tool to other contexts

## Expected Behavior

The agent should be able to:
1. See messages it has sent to channels when asked in DMs
2. Reference previous channel conversations
3. Maintain coherent conversation across channels and DMs
4. Have a unified view of its own activity

## Related Issues

This appears to be part of a broader session management problem:
- #2608 - Thread context not fetched
- #6096 - Slack thread context lost when messages queued  
- #4927 - inheritParent not injecting parent message

All of these share a common pattern: **session isolation prevents context visibility across different message contexts**.

## Technical Context

**Configuration:**
```json
"channels": {
  "slack": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "socket",
    "botToken": "xoxb-...",
    "appToken": "xapp-...",
    "userTokenReadOnly": true,
    "groupPolicy": "open"
  }
}

## Comments

### @trevorallred (2026-02-02)

Possible Solutions??

Option 1: Cross-Session Message History
When the agent queries its own activity, include messages from all related sessions (channels + DMs) in the context window.

Option 2: Unified Session for All Slack Activity
Instead of separate sessions per channel/DM, use a single session with context markers for where messages originated.

Option 3: Session Memory Hook
Create a hook that logs all outbound messages to a shared store that can be queried across sessions.

Impact
Current workarounds:

User must manually inform agent of its own actions
Agent cannot maintain coherent multi-context conversations
Reduces agent usefulness in team collaboration scenarios
User experience:

Confusing when agent denies sending messages it did send
Breaks conversational flow
Makes agent appear unreliable or buggy
Environment
OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30
Channel: Slack (socket mode)
Model: google/gemini-3-pro-preview (primary)
