## Description

## Summary

Cron jobs created via the `cron` tool appear to not persist across gateway restarts. After a gateway restart (SIGUSR1 or full stop/start), `cron list` returns an empty array — all previously configured jobs are gone.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a cron job:
   ```
   cron action=add job={name: "test", schedule: {kind: "every", everyMs: 3600000}, payload: {kind: "systemEvent", text: "hourly check"}, sessionTarget: "main"}
   ```
2. Verify: `cron list` → shows the job
3. Restart gateway: `gateway restart`
4. Check again: `cron list` → **empty array**

## Expected Behavior

Cron jobs should persist across gateway restarts. They should be stored in a durable location (config file, SQLite, or JSON file) and automatically restored on gateway startup.

## Impact

- **Agents must recreate all cron jobs** after every restart/upgrade/crash
- **Reminders are lost** if gateway restarts unexpectedly
- **Monitoring cron jobs** (health checks, email polling) silently stop
- Users may not realize their scheduled tasks are gone until they notice missing notifications

## Proposed Fix

1. **Persist cron jobs** to a file (e.g., `~/.openclaw/cron-jobs.json`)
2. **Restore on startup** — reload all enabled jobs from the persistence file
3. **Show warning** in gateway logs if persisted jobs were restored
4. **`cron export` / `cron import`** commands for manual backup/restore

## Workaround

Currently, agents must re-create cron jobs on every boot by checking for missing jobs in the heartbeat routine. This is fragile and wastes tokens.

## Environment

- OpenClaw 2026.1.30, Windows 10
- Observed across multiple restarts (both SIGUSR1 and full stop/start)
