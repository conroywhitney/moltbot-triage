## Description

Summary                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                 
  OpenClaw crashes on launch when no microphone/audio input device is available. The app attempts to initialize VoiceWakeRuntime which requires  
  audio input, but crashes instead of gracefully handling the missing device.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                 
  Steps to reproduce                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Use a Mac without built-in microphone (e.g., Mac mini) with no external microphone connected                                                
  2. Launch OpenClaw.app                                                                                                                         
  3. App crashes immediately                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                 
  Expected behavior                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                 
  The app should launch successfully and either:

  - Show a user-friendly message asking to connect a microphone                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                 
  Actual behavior

## Comments

### @sfo2001 (2026-01-31)

I've submitted a fix for this issue in PR #5656. The crash occurs because the app attempts to access the default audio input device during launch without checking if one exists. The fix adds a guard that checks for available audio input devices before accessing the default device.
