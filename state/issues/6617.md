## Description

## Summary

Our agent is not able to reply us with any inline image in their markdown response.

## Proposed solution

We should also support the same Markdown syntax that GitHub-flavored Markdown supports.

## Alternatives considered

Otherwise, an image can be a more special attachment that gets sent and rendered.
