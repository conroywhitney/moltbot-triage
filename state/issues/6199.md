## Description

Description

Sessions display channel: "whatsapp" and displayName: "whatsapp:g-agent-*" even when no WhatsApp channel is configured. This causes confusion in the session list UI and logs.

Environment

OpenClaw version: 2026.1.30 (76b5208)
OS: Linux
Only channel configured: Telegram
Expected behavior
Session channel should reflect the actual channel (e.g., telegram) or be null/undefined when no specific channel applies.

Actual behavior

sessions_list returns channel: "whatsapp" for all sessions
displayName shows whatsapp:g-agent-*-main
Gateway logs show messageChannel=whatsapp in embedded run entries
However, deliveryContext correctly shows telegram
Config (relevant parts)

{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": { "enabled": true }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "telegram": { "enabled": true }
    }
  }
}
No WhatsApp channel, plugin, or binding is configured.

Evidence from sessions_list

{
  "key": "agent:main",
  "channel": "whatsapp",
  "displayName": "whatsapp:g-agent-main",
  "deliveryContext": {
    "channel": "telegram"
  }
}
Impact
Cosmetic/confusing — initially thought this might be unauthorized access until verifying no WhatsApp connections exist.

## Comments

### @ajGulati05 (2026-02-01)

It looks like this is the default behavior until channels are set up and you have open messages or chats.

One idea would be to allow switching chats from there, but based on how this works today, sending a message from the UI to any channel will appear as though the bot is messaging that session or channel.

We may need a way to differentiate between owner-initiated messages and bot-generated messages.
