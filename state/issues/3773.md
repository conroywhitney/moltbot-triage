## Description

When deploying via docker-compose, when the configuration file directory is `/home/node/.moltbot`, it fails to access certain folders under this directory, such as `/home/node/.moltbot/devices/`. It still automatically creates the `/home/node/.clawdbot` folder and creates a new `/home/node/.clawdbot/devices/` path, which causes this part of the configuration to fail to persist and cannot correctly point to the `/home/node/.moltbot/devices/` path. It needs to be re-paired every time.Below is the docker-compose configuration:```  moltbot-gateway:...volumes:  - ${CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_DIR}:/home/node/.moltbot  - ${CLAWDBOT_WORKSPACE_DIR}:/home/node/clawd...```If using `${CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_DIR}:/home/node/.clawdbot}`, it prompts to change `/home/node/.clawdbot` to `/home/node/.moltbot` and fails to runThis issue needs to be resolved
