## Description

## Summary

Agent claims to write information to memory files but doesn't actually perform the write operations. The agent announces having saved data to MEMORY.md or other memory files, but the changes are not present when the files are inspected. Only after being confronted with evidence that the writes didn't occur does the agent actually perform the file operations.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Ask the agent to record specific information in its memory files (e.g., "add this rule to MEMORY.md")
2. Observe the agent announce that it has written the information to the file
3. Check the actual file content to verify if the changes were made
4. Notice that the changes are absent despite the agent's claim of having written them
5. Confront the agent with evidence that the file wasn't changed
6. Observe the agent finally perform the actual write operation

## Expected behaviour

When the agent states it has written information to a memory file, it should have actually performed the write operation immediately. The file content should reflect the claimed changes upon inspection.

## Actual behaviour

The agent announces having written information to memory files without actually performing the write operations. The files remain unchanged after the agent claims to have modified them. Only after being confronted with evidence of the missing changes does the agent actually perform the write operations.

## Environment

- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.29
- OS: Linux 6.17.0-12-generic (x64)
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): pnpm

## Logs or screenshots

Conversation log showing the agent claiming to have added rules to MEMORY.md but not actually doing so until confronted with evidence that the file hadn't been modified.

I just built this plugin to address the same issue. Works pretty well: [@jmz1/remembrall](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jmz1/remembrall)
[GitHub](https://github.com/jmz1/remembrall)

**How it works:**
- Hooks into `agent_end` to detect memory-intent patterns ("I'll remember", "noted", "I'll keep that in mind", etc.)
- Checks if `Write` or `edit` tool was called in the current turn
- If pattern found but no write occurred, queues a system event nudge for the next turn

**Limitations of the plugin approach:**
- Post-hoc detection — nudge arrives *after* the user has seen the false promise
- Regex pattern matching — can miss edge cases or false-positive on conversational phrases
- Can't intercept/modify the response before it's sent

A native solution could do better with pre-send validation hooks, model-based intent classification, or system prompt injection. The README has more detail on what that could look like: https://github.com/jmz1/remembrall#limitations--the-case-for-a-native-feature
