## Description

## Summary
Console and file log timestamps are always UTC (ISO 8601 with `Z` suffix) regardless of the `TZ` environment variable.

## Current behavior
```
06:24:29 [slack] delivered reply to user:UR1CKQKE1
```
(UTC, even with `TZ=Asia/Tokyo`)

## Expected behavior
```
15:24:29 [slack] delivered reply to user:UR1CKQKE1
```
(Local time respecting `TZ` or a config option)

## Suggested solution
Add a config option like:
```json5
{
  gateway: {
    logging: {
      timezone: "local" // "utc" | "local" | IANA timezone
    }
  }
}
```

Or respect `TZ` env var for console output timestamps.

## Environment
- OS: WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- Node: v24.13.0
- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
