## Description

## Problem

When agents use the exec tool to send tmux commands via `tmux send-keys`, the command gets pasted into the tmux session but doesn't execute. The agent thinks the command succeeded, but it's actually waiting for the user to manually press Enter.

## Example failure pattern

1. Agent executes: `tmux send-keys -t session "echo hello"`
2. Command appears in tmux pane but doesn't run
3. Agent waits or reports success
4. Nothing happens - human has to manually press Enter in the tmux session

## Impact

This breaks agent automation workflows that rely on tmux for:
- Running interactive CLIs (coding agents like Codex, Claude Code)
- Managing long-running processes
- Orchestrating multiple parallel sessions

## Expected behavior

When an agent sends a tmux command, it should execute automatically without requiring manual intervention.

## Proposed solution

Add an optional `autoEnter` parameter to the exec tool that automatically appends `Enter` to tmux send-keys commands when it's missing.
