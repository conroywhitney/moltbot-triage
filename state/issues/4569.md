Can you please tell me the purpose of this, since we will require brew to install git as well right?, is there any inherent benefit of using nvm instead?

### @AmagiDDmxh (2026-01-30)

Hi, @hangyakuzero, thanks for the reply. Yep, I forgot that there's an alternative solution. Just by using the Node version manager, you have to switch the version and restart the setup script.

The benefit of this is that the Node.js download is an unnecessary step when you have nvm, fnm, etc.




### @hangyakuzero (2026-01-30)

ahh ok got it, so what you might be suggesting is, initially we can do something like check whether nvm exists, then run nvm list and filter out the versions using a grep command, and then switch to that version if available?, cool make sense now

### @AmagiDDmxh (2026-01-30)

yep! though that sounds complicated, maybe there are more elegant ways to do this.
