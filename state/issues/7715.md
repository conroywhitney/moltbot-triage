## Description

## Problem

When a new device (e.g., ClawReach mobile app) connects to the gateway for the first time, it requires pairing approval. Currently, after approving a device in `devices/pending.json` → `devices/paired.json`, a full **gateway restart** is required for the approval to take effect.

This creates a poor UX, especially for mobile apps:
1. Device connects → "pairing required" rejection
2. Admin approves the device (via script, API, or manually)
3. **Gateway must be restarted** before the device can connect
4. Device reconnects after restart

If the device opens multiple connections with different roles (e.g., `webchat` + `node`), this can require **multiple approve + restart cycles**.

## Proposed Solution

The gateway should watch `devices/paired.json` (or equivalent pairing store) for changes and hot-reload approved devices without requiring a restart. Options:

1. **File watcher** — `fs.watch()` on the pairing store file, reload on change
2. **In-memory refresh** — periodically re-read the pairing store (e.g., every 5-10s)
3. **API-triggered reload** — expose a `gateway.reloadPairings` method or have the approve API trigger an in-memory refresh

Option 1 or 3 would give instant approval pickup. Option 2 is simpler but adds a small delay.

## Context

- Filed from ClawReach (Flutter mobile client) development
- Related to the dual-connection pattern (operator + node) requiring separate pairing approvals
- Current workaround: `systemctl restart` gateway after each approval
- Telegram plugin already uses a shared pairing store (#6127) — this could build on that

## Expected Behavior

After a device is approved (via any mechanism), the gateway should accept connections from that device within seconds, without a restart.
