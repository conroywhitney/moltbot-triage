## Description

## Problem
sessions_spawn model overrides can be ignored because the resolved model isn't consistently applied when invoking the gateway agent call.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Call sessions_spawn with an explicit model override.
2. Inspect the model used by the spawned agent.

## Expected behavior
The spawned agent should run with the requested model override.

## Actual behavior
The run can proceed with defaults if the override isn't applied at agent call time.
