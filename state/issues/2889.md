## Description

## Summary

When using Clawdbot with a **Google Antigravity account**, the default model (**Opus 4.5**) works correctly. However, sending a WhatsApp message asking to switch the model to **Antigravity’s Gemini Flash** causes the LLM request to fail with a missing `tool_use.input` field error.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install and configure Clawdbot on macOS (MacBook Pro) using pnpm.
2. Log in to Clawdbot using **Google Antigravity account**.
3. Confirm the default model is **Opus 4.5**.
4. Send the following message via **WhatsApp**, routed through the **Clawdbot Gateway**:

   > “are you able switch to antigravity’s gemini flash?”

## Expected behavior

The assistant should either:

* Switch the model to Antigravity Gemini Flash, **or**
* Respond gracefully if model switching is not supported via WhatsApp.

In all cases, the request should not fail.

## Actual behavior

The request fails immediately and returns the following error:

```
LLM request rejected: messages.3.content.1.tool_use.input: Field required
```

## Environment

* Clawdbot version: *TBD*
* OS: macOS (MacBook Pro)
* Install method: pnpm
* Auth method: Google → Antigravity
* Channel: WhatsApp → Clawdbot Gateway

## Logs or screenshots

```
LLM request rejected: messages.3.content.1.tool_use.input: Field required
```

## Comments

### @ken88ling (2026-01-28)

❓ I think this is Code Bug

1. **Model-side issue**: The AI model (Claude via google-antigravity) incorrectly omitted the arguments field when calling session_status with no parameters.

2. **MoltBot could be more defensive**: Ideally MoltBot should sanitize tool calls before saving them (add arguments: {} if missing), or filter out malformed messages when loading history.

3. **It's a known edge case**: This happens rarely when the model "forgets" to include arguments for tools that don't require any.
