### @dial481 (2026-01-31)

I also get this often in openclaw tui.

### @dnvnxg (2026-01-31)

~~Same here. I think it has to do with OAuth with Anthropic because signing in with Copilot works.~~
Nevermind no it doesn't it seems

### @replete-genie (2026-01-31)

Same here, it seems to be broken, similar to #2697 (solutions don't seem to apply any more)

### @dnvnxg (2026-01-31)

Okay scratch my previous "disregard". It is definitely related to Anthropic OAuth. Switching to API key works just as it's supposed to

### @13738-pixel (2026-01-31)

I ran into this problem when using OpenRouter with DeepSeek, and it worked fine after I added the DeepSeek config directly in the JSON file.

### @ethsze (2026-01-31)

@13738-pixel Same problem, having tried Claude, Kimi, and DeepSeek. How did you set up your config?

### @gitguanjia (2026-01-31)

same problem after I try gemini3

### @dial481 (2026-01-31)

Jost got (no output) again with a brand new install of 2026.1.29, very minimal config, MiniMax-M2.1 configured as the only model and API key. Fortunately Telegram seems to work and I only see this in openclaw tui.


### @areslp (2026-01-31)

same problem, 2026.1.29, minimax m2.1, no output in tui and web.

### @xiang-lee (2026-02-01)

in openclaw tui,  it you saw no output,  try /quit, and then "openclaw tui", (try a few times), this trick makes it work, not sure why. 

### @dial481 (2026-02-01)

> in openclaw tui, it you saw no output, try /quit, and then "openclaw tui", (try a few times), this trick makes it work, not sure why.

I still get it after /quit and restart, /reset and /new. Sometimes messages come through but I get a lot of (no output). It's totally unclear what's causing it.

### @jmdkina (2026-02-01)

I use Minimax saw no output, but normal with glm and moonshot, why? 

### @dial481 (2026-02-01)

@jmdkina I've seen it with many different models

### @MingXXI (2026-02-01)

I've tried on Qwen, issue occurs. Also replace the token manually doesn't work on my elderly Mac mini LOL

### @summer521521 (2026-02-02)

我使用了codex/gpt-5.2的OAuth，跳过skill和app，也出现了这个问题，tui和web都是no output

### @happyo (2026-02-02)

Using copilot, the same issue, no output

### @LDLZM (2026-02-02)

I also face the problem


### @lightclient (2026-02-02)

Also seeing this a lot.
