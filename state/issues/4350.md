## Description

When the primary model (e.g. openai-codex/gpt-5.1) hits rate limits, the fallback chain is not being used.

Config:
```json
"model": {
  "primary": "openai-codex/gpt-5.1",
  "fallbacks": ["anthropic/claude-opus-4-5", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"]
}
```

Expected: When Codex returns 429/rate limit, automatically try the next fallback (Opus).
Actual: Stays stuck on the rate-limited model.

## Comments

### @Glucksberg (2026-01-30)

🔗 **Related:** This appears to be the same class of issue as #4260 (provider-level cooldown blocking cross-provider fallback). PR #4312 addresses this by allowing fallback models from different providers to be tried even when the original provider is in cooldown.

Worth testing if #4312 resolves this scenario as well.
