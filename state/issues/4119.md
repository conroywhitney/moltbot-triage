## Description

**Description**
Voice calls using the Telnyx provider work for outbound audio (user can hear the assistant), but transcription doesn't start automatically, so the assistant cannot hear what the user says.

**Root Cause**
The voice-call plugin doesn't send the `transcription_start` command when a call is answered. According to Telnyx support, transcription must be explicitly started via the Call Control API.

**Current Behavior**
In `extensions/voice-call/src/manager/events.ts`, the `call.answered` event handler:
• Records timestamp
• Transitions state
• Starts max duration timer
• Does NOT call `ctx.provider.startListening()`

**Expected Behavior**
When a `call.answered` event is received, the plugin should automatically call `startListening()` to enable transcription.

Reproduction

1. Configure voice-call plugin with Telnyx provider
2. Make an outbound call
3. Answer the call and speak
4. Observe: no `call.transcription` events are received
Evidence

Webhook logs show these events arriving:
• ✅ `call.initiated`
• ✅ `call.answered`
• ✅ `call.speak.started/ended`
• ❌ `call.transcription` (never received)

**Proposed Fix**
Add transcription start in the `call.answered` case:

`case "call.answered":
  call.answeredAt = event.timestamp;
  transitionState(call, "answered");
  startMaxDurationTimer({
    ctx,
    callId: call.callId,
    onTimeout: async (callId) => {
      await endCall(ctx, callId);
    },
  });
  // Start transcription when call is answered
  if (ctx.provider && call.providerCallId) {
    ctx.provider.startListening({
      providerCallId: call.providerCallId,
      language: "en",
    })`

`catch((err) => {
console.error([voice-call] Failed to start transcription for ${call.callId}:, err);
});
}
break;`

**Environment**
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Provider: Telnyx
- Platform: Linux

**Note**
The `TelnyxProvider.startListening()` method already exists and is implemented correctly - it just needs to be called automatically when calls connect.
