## Description

**Description**
Voice calls using the Telnyx provider work for outbound audio (user can hear the assistant), but transcription doesn't start automatically, so the assistant cannot hear what the user says.

**Root Cause**
The voice-call plugin doesn't send the `transcription_start` command when a call is answered. According to Telnyx support, transcription must be explicitly started via the Call Control API.

**Current Behavior**
In `extensions/voice-call/src/manager/events.ts`, the `call.answered` event handler:
• Records timestamp
• Transitions state
• Starts max duration timer
• Does NOT call `ctx.provider.startListening()`

**Expected Behavior**
When a `call.answered` event is received, the plugin should automatically call `startListening()` to enable transcription.

Reproduction

1. Configure voice-call plugin with Telnyx provider
2. Make an outbound call
3. Answer the call and speak
4. Observe: no `call.transcription` events are received
Evidence

Webhook logs show these events arriving:
• ✅ `call.initiated`
• ✅ `call.answered`
• ✅ `call.speak.started/ended`
• ❌ `call.transcription` (never received)

**Proposed Fix**
Add transcription start in the `call.answered` case:

`case "call.answered":
  call.answeredAt = event.timestamp;
  transitionState(call, "answered");
  startMaxDurationTimer({
    ctx,
    callId: call.callId,
    onTimeout: async (callId) => {
      await endCall(ctx, callId);
    },
  });
  // Start transcription when call is answered
  if (ctx.provider && call.providerCallId) {
    ctx.provider.startListening({
      providerCallId: call.providerCallId,
      language: "en",
    })`

`catch((err) => {
console.error([voice-call] Failed to start transcription for ${call.callId}:, err);
});
}
break;`

**Environment**
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Provider: Telnyx
- Platform: Linux

**Note**
The `TelnyxProvider.startListening()` method already exists and is implemented correctly - it just needs to be called automatically when calls connect.

## Comments

### @tturnerdev (2026-02-03)

I can confirm I just ran into this issue. However, after reading the docs, I'm not sure transcription is /supposed/ to happen for "outbound voice notifications". I.e. I think these are meant to be one way voice alerts where no listen is expected.

See examples in the **CLI** section of the docs:
https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/voice-call#cli

```
openclaw voicecall call --to "+15555550123" --message "Hello from OpenClaw"
openclaw voicecall continue --call-id <id> --message "Any questions?"
openclaw voicecall speak --call-id <id> --message "One moment"
```
It seems like the use cases are:
- (init) `call`: Start a call with initial voice message to the user
- (prompt) `continue`: Ask a question and wait for a response transcription (this is where the `call.transcription_start` is currently located I believe?)
- (notice) `speak`: Make a statement or give user notice (specifically, not waiting for response, might be triggered by something else.)

So I'm not sure the bug tag is warranted here... it seems the "conversational" functionality would be an enhancement/feature request to "allow user response after an voice alert message."
