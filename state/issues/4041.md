## Description

## Feature Request

**Summary:** Add file/document upload support to the WebChat interface (Control UI chat tab).

**Current behavior:** WebChat shows `capabilities=none` and has no UI for attaching files. Users cannot drag-and-drop or upload documents to send to the agent.

**Desired behavior:** Allow users to drag files into the chat input or click an attachment button to upload files (images, documents, etc.) that get passed to the agent, similar to how WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord channels handle attachments.

**Workarounds:** 
- Send files via WhatsApp or other configured channels
- Drop files in the workspace folder and reference by path

**Use case:** Quick file sharing when working from the browser-based Control UI, especially for users who primarily interact via WebChat.
