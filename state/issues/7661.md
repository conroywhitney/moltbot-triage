## Description

## Feature Request

**Action needed:** `channel create` or similar for the `message` tool

**Current state:**
- OpenClaw CLI has `openclaw message channel` with only `info` and `list` subcommands
- Users can grant bots `channels:manage` scope in Slack
- No way to programmatically create channels from OpenClaw

**Use case:**
Autonomous channel management for organizing Slack workspaces (e.g., auto-create #leads, #content, #dev channels for workflow automation)

**Proposed API:**
```bash
openclaw message channel create --channel slack --name leads --topic "Lead Discovery Hub" --private false
```

Or via tool call:
```json
{
  "action": "channel-create",
  "channel": "slack",
  "name": "leads",
  "topic": "Lead Discovery Hub",
  "private": false
}
```

**Providers to support:**
- Slack (`conversations.create` API)
- Discord (`POST /guilds/{guild.id}/channels`)
- Other messaging platforms as applicable

**Alternative workaround:**
Currently using curl + Slack Web API directly, but native support would be cleaner.
