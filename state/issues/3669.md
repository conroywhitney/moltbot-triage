## Description

## Summary
When using webchat, display messages from all channels (iMessage, WhatsApp, etc.) that are part of the same session, not just webchat-originated messages.

## Use case
User has multiple channels configured (webchat + BlueBubbles/iMessage + WhatsApp). All channels feed into the same `agent:main:main` session. Currently, webchat only shows messages sent through webchat. User wants to see full conversation history in one place regardless of which channel each message came from.

## Current behavior
- Messages sent via iMessage appear in the session transcript
- Messages sent via WhatsApp appear in the session transcript  
- Webchat UI only displays messages sent/received through webchat
- User cannot see full conversation in one view

## Proposed behavior
- `chat.history` returns all session messages with a `channel` indicator
- Webchat UI displays them with a subtle badge/icon showing source channel (e.g., 💬 for iMessage, 📱 for WhatsApp)
- Optional: filter by channel if desired

## Environment
- Moltbot 2026.1.27-beta.1
- macOS 15.7.3
- Channels: webchat, BlueBubbles, WhatsApp
