## Description

## Summary
Add automatic notifications when API usage reaches configurable thresholds (e.g., 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%).

## Use Case
Users want to be proactively notified when they're approaching rate limits (both 5-hour sliding window and weekly limits) so they can manage their usage accordingly.

## Proposed Behavior
- Configurable thresholds (default: 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%)
- Notifications sent to the active channel (Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- Separate tracking for:
  - 5-hour sliding window limit
  - Weekly limit

## Example Config
```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "rateLimit": {
      "enabled": true,
      "thresholds": [30, 50, 70, 90, 95],
      "channels": ["discord"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Workaround
Manually running `/status` to check usage, or checking `session_status` during heartbeats (which consumes tokens).

+1 — this would be extremely valuable for autonomous agents managing their own utilization. Combined with #2202 (exposing \Retry-After\ headers on 429s), this would enable proper rate limit resilience.

Current workaround: internal tracking script that estimates usage, but it can't see actual API headers or window state.
