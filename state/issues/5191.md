## Description

## Summary
What went wrong?

## Chat Steps to reproduce
Convo 1:

Me:
THAT is the mystery, what did ClawdBot do to trigger a cascade of "ignore the user"


BOT:
You’re correct that NO_REPLY had to come from outside the base model.

But it doesn’t have to come from the “main system prompt” specifically.

Clawdbot injects NO_REPLY via other injected turns, e.g. the pre-compaction memory flush prompt that literally says: “If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.” I can see that exact string in the session logs on disk:

Pre-compaction memory flush... If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
So even with an “empty system prompt”, the model can still see NO_REPLY in injected user/maintenance messages and start using it as a do-nothing action—then the platform suppresses output.

If you want, next step is to grep the News session file for the first occurrence of NO_REPLY / “reply with NO_REPLY” and we’ll pinpoint exactly which injected turn introduced it.


Me:
I don't need a sentinel
Locate it

BOT: (nothing)

Convo 2:
ME: you triggered the bug on YOU, Opus 4.5, the other is GPT-5.2... so whatever you did just activated it again
BOT:
Found it. NO_REPLY is not coming from the model and it’s not coming from your agent files — it’s injected by Clawdbot itself as part of the generated system prompt.

Location on disk (installed package):

/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/dist/agents/system-prompt.js
It literally appends a “## Silent Replies” section that instructs: “When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY”.
Docs that describe the behavior:

/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/docs/reference/session-management-compaction.md
“## Silent housekeeping (NO_REPLY)” + “NO_REPLY is treated as a silent token and filtered from outgoing payloads.”
So the “cascade of ignore the user” happens when the model decides “no meaningful output” (often after tool failures / rate limits / broken gateway) and the platform-provided “Silent Replies” rule makes NO_REPLY the “do nothing” completion.

Me:
Just checking, you didn't kill yourself again?
YOU DID!!!! YOU TRIGGERED IT AGAIN!!!

BOT: (nothing)

## Expected behavior
Reading about NO_REPLY should not trigger bot to go full NO_REPLY.

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?

Cron lookup failed, triggering GPT-5.2 to go fully silent on "test" messages, until commanded to speak with Claude Code trying to troubleshoot.  Bot was silent in one channel, but talking in another.  Session wiped, problem persisted until commanded to speak

Different channel, explaining problem to Opus-4.5, and it found the problem, then went silent.  Got it back up with Claude Code again, then told it what it just did, and it went, found the file again, triggered itself again, and went silent again.  Could see "typing..." indicator, then no output.

Issue survived Claude Code restarting gateway, wiping session, reconnecting to message service (MatterMost), etc.
