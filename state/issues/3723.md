## Description

## Description
When switching between sessions in the Chat tab dropdown, the chat history shows 0 messages even when messages exist for that session.

## Debug Info
- `loadChatHistory: starting, sessionKey="agent:main:whatsapp:group:120363421888880908@g.us"`
- `loadChatHistory: got 0 messages`

## Root Cause
Session transcript files (*.jsonl) don't exist or aren't being created when messages are sent/received through webchat.

## Expected Behavior
Switching sessions should load and display the chat history for that session.
