## Description

## Description
Clicking the "New session" button in the Chat tab doesn't create a new session. The button sends `/new` as a chat message but nothing happens.

## Expected Behavior
Clicking "New session" should:
1. Create a new chat session
2. Clear the current chat history
3. Add the new session to the dropdown

## Current Behavior
Button click appears to do nothing visible.

🔗 **Related webchat session bugs:** #3726 (new sessions not appearing in dropdown), #3723 (switching sessions doesn't load history). PR #3721 also addresses webchat display issues - these may share root causes in session state management.

I've been experimenting the same issue not only with the /new command but also /status/help or any of the other /commands in the web chat UI. I tried to replicate the problem and I did a clean new install and everything was working fine until I installed the WhatsApp channel. After finishing the binding of my phone to the WhatsApp channel, this behavior started to happen again. So I think there is something related to the WhatsApp channel, the permissions around sessions and some sort of security trigger that censors the /command. It seems that it doesn't recognize that you have the permission to enter that command in the UI
