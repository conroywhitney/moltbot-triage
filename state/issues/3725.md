## Description

## Description
Clicking the "New session" button in the Chat tab doesn't create a new session. The button sends `/new` as a chat message but nothing happens.

## Expected Behavior
Clicking "New session" should:
1. Create a new chat session
2. Clear the current chat history
3. Add the new session to the dropdown

## Current Behavior
Button click appears to do nothing visible.

🔗 **Related webchat session bugs:** #3726 (new sessions not appearing in dropdown), #3723 (switching sessions doesn't load history). PR #3721 also addresses webchat display issues - these may share root causes in session state management.
