## Description

When a cron job uses sessionTarget=main with payload.kind=systemEvent, it injects a system event into the main session. If the main session is currently routed to a Discord channel (e.g. last active channel), the agent response to that system event can be delivered into that channel.

This caused automated research cron reminders to post internal narration into #scoobdev.

Request: provide a first-class way to suppress delivery for cron-triggered main-session systemEvents (default to no outbound delivery), or require an explicit delivery target for cron jobs, or tag cron systemEvents as "internal" so agent output is not auto-delivered unless explicitly requested.

Workarounds today: use isolated agentTurn jobs with deliver=false, or craft systemEvent text to instruct agent to output NO_REPLY unless actionable. But it would be better if the system made the safe behavior the default.
