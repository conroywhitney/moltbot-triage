## Description

## Summary
Openclaw is not creating new sessions when using the Web UI chat commands like "/new" but it works on other channels like whatsapp.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Go to web UI chat
2. Click "New session" or type "/new"
3. Press enter

## Expected behavior
Before it used to clear the chat and create a new session, but now it is not.

## Actual behavior
The chat did not clear the chat indicating that a new session was made. This works when using a different channel like Whatsapp but for some reason it is not working in the web UI.

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.29
- OS: MacOS Tahoe Version 26.2
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): "curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash"

Does anyone know why this is happening? And how can I fix it?
